In today's tech-driven world, it is crucial to maintain a record of every change made to data in order to track and improve processes, identify and resolve issues, and meet legal and compliance requirements. When working with Django, an open-source Python web framework, one powerful feature that can assist in achieving this is **model versioning and historical records**.

## What is Model Versioning?

Model versioning refers to the ability to store different versions of a Django model and track the changes made between those versions. It allows you to keep an audit trail of every modification to your database records, ensuring the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.

## Django Simple History

Django Simple History is a popular third-party library that provides a simplified approach to tracking model changes and maintaining historical data. It adds a historical record for every created, modified, or deleted instance of a model. This library integrates seamlessly with Django's models and provides a rich set of features.

To start using Django Simple History, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Installation

Install Django Simple History using pip:

```bash
pip install django-simple-history
```

### Step 2: Configuration

Add `"simple_history"` to your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'simple_history',
    ...
]
```

### Step 3: Enable Historical Records

Add historical tracking to your models by inheriting from the `HistoricalRecords` class provided by Django Simple History. For example:

```python
from django.db import models
from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publication_date = models.DateField()

    history = HistoricalRecords()
```

### Step 4: Migrate

Run the database migrations to create the historical records table:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

That's it! Your Django model is now being tracked for changes, and historical records will be stored automatically.

## Retrieving Historical Records

Django Simple History provides a simple and intuitive API to access historical records for any model instance. Here are a few examples:

### Retrieve All Historical Records

To retrieve all historical records for a model instance, you can use the `historical.all()` method. For instance:

```python
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
history = book.history.all()
```

### Retrieve Specific Version

To retrieve a specific version of the model instance, you can use the `historical.get()` method. Here's an example:

```python
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
version = book.history.get(history_id=42)
```

### Retrieve Most Recent Version

If you only need the most recent version, you can access it directly via the `latest_history` attribute. For example:

```python
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
latest_version = book.history.latest_history
```

## Conclusion

By implementing Django model versioning with the Django Simple History library, you can easily track and manage historical records for your models. This provides a valuable audit trail and allows you to retrieve or revert to previous versions if necessary. Start leveraging this powerful functionality today to ensure the integrity and reliability of your data.
