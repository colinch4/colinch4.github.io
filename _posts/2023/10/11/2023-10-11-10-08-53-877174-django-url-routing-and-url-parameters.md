One of the key aspects of building a web application is defining the URL patterns and routes. In Django, URL routing is handled by the **URLconf** (URL configuration) module. It maps URLs to views, allowing users to access different pages and functionalities within the application.

## Defining URL Patterns

In Django, URL patterns are defined in the **urls.py** file located in the application directory. This file acts as a centralized hub for URL configuration. Let's take a look at a simple example:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('products/<int:id>/', views.product_details, name='product_details'),
]
```

In the above example, we have defined three URL patterns using the `path()` function. The first pattern maps the root URL (`/`) to the `home` view function. The second pattern maps the `/about/` URL to the `about` view function. The third pattern is a dynamic URL that maps URLs like `/products/1/`, `/products/2/`, etc. to the `product_details` view function, passing the `id` parameter as an integer.

## Accessing URL Parameters

URL parameters allow us to pass values dynamically in the URL. In the example above, we have a URL pattern with `<int:id>/` which captures an integer value and assigns it to the `id` parameter.

To access the value of the URL parameter in the view function, we need to define a parameter with the same name in the function signature. Let's see an example:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def product_details(request, id):
    # Retrieve the product from the database using the id parameter
    product = Product.objects.get(id=id)
    return render(request, 'product_details.html', {'product': product})
```

In the `product_details` view function, we retrieve the product from the database using the `id` parameter. This allows us to show the details dynamically based on the URL parameter value.

## Conclusion

URL routing and URL parameters are fundamental concepts in Django web development. By defining URL patterns and using dynamic parameters, we can create flexible and interactive web applications. Understanding how to define URL patterns and access URL parameters in Django is essential for building robust and user-friendly web applications.
