In Django, **class-based views** provide a way to structure and organize your application's views using Python classes instead of functions. They offer a powerful and flexible approach to handling requests and can be extended and customized using **mixins**.

## What are Class-Based View Mixins?

Mixins are small, reusable classes that provide additional functionality to class-based views. They allow you to add specific behaviors to your views without having to repeat code across multiple views.

In Django, mixins are implemented using **multiple inheritance**. By inheriting from one or more mixins, you can enhance your views with additional features and capabilities.

## Common Mixins in Django

Django provides several built-in mixins that you can use to extend your class-based views. Here are some of the commonly used ones:

### 1. `LoginRequiredMixin`

The `LoginRequiredMixin` mixin requires the user to be authenticated before accessing the view. If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin

class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
    login_url = '/login/'
    redirect_field_name = 'redirect_to'
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
```

### 2. `PermissionRequiredMixin`

The `PermissionRequiredMixin` mixin verifies if the user has the necessary permissions to access the view. If the user lacks the required permissions, they will be redirected to a specified URL.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin

class MyView(PermissionRequiredMixin, View):
    permission_required = 'app.view_model'
    raise_exception = True
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
```

### 3. `FormMixin`

The `FormMixin` provides form handling capabilities to your views. It handles the validation and processing of submitted forms.

```python
from django.views.generic.edit import FormView
from myapp.forms import MyForm

class MyView(FormMixin, View):
    form_class = MyForm
    template_name = 'myapp/myview.html'
    
    def get(self, request):
        form = self.get_form()
        context = {'form': form}
        return self.render_to_response(context)
    
    def post(self, request):
        form = self.get_form()
        if form.is_valid():
            # Process the form data
            return self.form_valid(form)
        else:
            return self.form_invalid(form)
```

## Summary

Class-based view mixins in Django allow you to enhance and customize your views by adding specific behaviors. They provide a modular and reusable way to extend your views without duplicating code. Django offers various built-in mixins, such as `LoginRequiredMixin`, `PermissionRequiredMixin`, and `FormMixin`, which you can employ to add authentication, permission checks, and form handling to your views effortlessly.
