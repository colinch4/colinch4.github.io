When working on a Django project, it is essential to have different configurations for different environments such as development, staging, and production. By having separate configurations, you can easily switch between settings depending on the environment where your project is deployed.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to set up and manage different configurations for a Django project using the `python-decouple` library and the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable.

## Setting up `python-decouple`

The `python-decouple` library helps manage project configurations using environment variables or separate configuration files in different formats like `.env` or `.ini`. It provides a simple interface to access and manage these configurations.

To install `python-decouple` in your Django project, use the following command:

```bash
pip install python-decouple
```

## Configuration File Setup

Create a configuration file in the root directory of your Django project. Typical names for these files include `.env`, `config.ini`, or `settings.ini`, among others. Here, we will use the `.env` file.

In the `.env` file, define the configuration variables specific to each environment. For example:

```ini
# Development Settings
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dev_db

# Staging Settings
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@staging_server:5432/staging_db

# Production Settings
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@production_server:5432/production_db
```

## Environment-Specific Settings

In your Django project's `settings.py` file, update the configuration to make use of the `python-decouple` library to read the environment-specific settings.

```python
import os
from decouple import config

DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'HOST': config('DATABASE_URL'),
        'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600,
    }
}

# Other common settings...

```

In the example above, we are utilizing the `config` function from `decouple` to read the values of `DEBUG` and `DATABASE_URL` from the configuration file based on the environment.

## Switching Between Environments

To switch between environments, you need to set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable.

For example, to run your Django project using the development settings:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myproj.settings.dev
```

You can define separate modules in your Django project for each environment (e.g., `dev.py`, `staging.py`, `prod.py`), each importing the base settings and overriding the environment-specific variables.

By switching the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable, you can easily switch between different environments without modifying the code.

## Conclusion

Setting up different configurations for different environments in a Django project is crucial for managing and deploying the project seamlessly. By using the `python-decouple` library and managing the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, you can easily customize and switch between different settings, making your development, staging, and production environments distinct and reliable.
