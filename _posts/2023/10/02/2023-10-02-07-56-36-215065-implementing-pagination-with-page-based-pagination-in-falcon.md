Pagination is an important functionality to implement when dealing with large sets of data in web applications. It allows users to navigate through different pages of data, improving the user experience and reducing the load on the server. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pagination with page-based pagination in Falcon, a lightweight Python web framework.

### What is Page-Based Pagination?

Page-based pagination is a common method of pagination where the data is divided into individual pages, and users can navigate through these pages using previous and next buttons or by directly selecting a specific page. Each page typically contains a fixed number of items, such as 10, 20, or 50.

### Setting Up Falcon

Before we dive into implementing pagination, let's quickly set up a basic Falcon application.

First, make sure you have Falcon installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
$ pip install falcon
```

Next, create a new Python file, `app.py`, and import the necessary modules:

```python
import falcon
from falcon import HTTP_404
```

Now, let's define a simple Falcon resource that will serve as our endpoint for paginated data:

```python
class PaginatedDataResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        # TODO: Implement pagination logic here
        pass
```

To complete the setup, we need to create a Falcon application and add our resource to it:

```python
app = falcon.API()
app.add_route('/data', PaginatedDataResource())
```

### Implementing Pagination Logic

To implement pagination, we need to modify the `PaginatedDataResource` class. We'll start by defining some variables to hold the current page and the number of items per page. Let's set the default values for these variables:

```python
class PaginatedDataResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        page = int(req.get_param('page', default='1'))
        per_page = int(req.get_param('per_page', default='10'))
```

Next, we need to fetch the data based on the current page and the number of items per page. Depending on your specific application, this could involve querying a database or fetching data from another API. For simplicity, let's assume we have a list of data that we want to paginate:

```python
class PaginatedDataResource:
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        page = int(req.get_param('page', default='1'))
        per_page = int(req.get_param('per_page', default='10'))

        start = (page - 1) * per_page
        end = start + per_page

        paginated_data = self.data[start:end]
```

Now, we have `paginated_data`, which contains only the items for the current page. We can return this data as a JSON response:

```python
class PaginatedDataResource:
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        # Pagination logic omitted
      
        paginated_data = self.data[start:end]

        resp.media = {'data': paginated_data}
```

### Testing Pagination

To test our pagination implementation, we can use tools like cURL or Postman. Make a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/data?page=1&per_page=10`. The response should include the paginated data for the first page:

```json
{
  "data": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
}
```

Changing the page number and items per page in the URL parameters will return the corresponding paginated data.

### Conclusion

Implementing pagination with page-based pagination in Falcon is straightforward. By dividing the data into pages and using the page and per_page parameters, we can easily navigate through large sets of data in a web application. Remember to customize the pagination logic based on your specific requirements and integrate it with your data source.
