Pagination is a common technique used in web applications to break down large datasets into smaller chunks, making it easier for users to navigate through the content. Token-based pagination offers a seamless user experience by providing a unique token that can be used to retrieve the next set of results.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement token-based pagination in Falcon, a lightweight Python framework for building API applications.

## Setting up the Environment

Before we begin, make sure you have Falcon installed in your Python environment. You can install Falcon using pip:

```bash
pip install falcon
```

Once Falcon is installed, let's start implementing the token-based pagination feature.

## Implementing Token-based Pagination

First, let's create a simple API endpoint that will return paginated data. For the sake of demonstration, let's assume we have a list of users as our dataset.

```python
import falcon

class UsersResource:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        token = req.get_param('token')
        page_size = 3

        if token:
            last_index = self.users.index(int(token)) + 1
            users = self.users[last_index:last_index + page_size]
        else:
            users = self.users[:page_size]

        if len(users) > 0:
            resp.media = {'users': users, 'next_token': str(users[-1])}
        else:
            resp.media = {'users': [], 'next_token': None}

app = falcon.App()
app.add_route('/users', UsersResource())
```

In the above code, we define a `UsersResource` class that initializes a list of users. The `on_get` method handles GET requests and retrieves the user list based on the provided token. If no token is provided, it returns the first page of users. If a token is provided, it returns the next page of users starting from the user with that token.

The response includes the `users` list and the `next_token` which represents the token for the next page. If there are no more pages, the `next_token` is set to `None`.

## Testing the Endpoint

To test the endpoint, we can use a tool like cURL or a web browser. Let's assume we are running the API on `localhost` at port `8000`.

```bash
# Request the first page of users
curl http://localhost:8000/users

# Request the next page of users using the provided token
curl http://localhost:8000/users?token=4
```

The first request will return the first page of users, and the response will include the `next_token` for the next page. The second request uses the `next_token` to retrieve the next page of users. Repeat this process until there are no more pages (`next_token` is `None`).

## Conclusion

Implementing token-based pagination in Falcon allows us to efficiently handle large datasets and provide a seamless user experience. By breaking down data into manageable chunks, we improve performance and make it easier for users to navigate through the content.

By following the example provided in this blog post, you can integrate token-based pagination in your Falcon-based API applications. Enjoy building scalable and user-friendly APIs with Falcon!
