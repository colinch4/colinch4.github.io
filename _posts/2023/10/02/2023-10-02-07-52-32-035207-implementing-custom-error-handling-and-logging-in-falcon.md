In any application, it is important to handle errors gracefully and have a robust logging mechanism to track down issues. Falcon, a lightweight Python web framework, provides a flexible way to implement custom error handling and logging. In this blog post, we will explore how to add custom error handling and logging to a Falcon application.

## Custom Error Handling

By default, Falcon returns error responses with a generic HTTP status code and message. To provide more meaningful error messages to clients, we can implement custom error handling using Falcon's middleware.

First, let's create an `ErrorMiddleware` class that inherits from `falcon.Middleware` and override the `process_response` method. This method is called after the response has been created and allows us to modify or completely replace the response.

```python
import falcon

class ErrorMiddleware:
    def process_response(self, req, resp, resource, req_succeeded):
        if not req_succeeded:
            # Handle error response here
            error_message = resp.body.decode()

            # Customize the error message based on the status code
            if resp.status == falcon.HTTP_404:
                error_message = "The requested resource was not found."
            elif resp.status == falcon.HTTP_500:
                error_message = "Internal server error occurred."

            # Replace the response with a custom error response
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_400
            resp.body = error_message.encode()
```

To activate the error middleware, add an instance of `ErrorMiddleware` to your Falcon API:

```python
api = falcon.API(middleware=[ErrorMiddleware()])
```

Now, any error responses returned by your API will be intercepted by the `ErrorMiddleware` and modified according to your custom logic.

## Logging

Logging is crucial for debugging and monitoring purposes. Falcon provides a convenient way to integrate logging with its middleware.

To enable logging, we can create a custom middleware class, `LoggingMiddleware`, that inherits from `falcon.Middleware`:

```python
import falcon
import logging

class LoggingMiddleware:
    def process_request(self, req, resp):
        logger = logging.getLogger('falcon')
        logger.info(f'{req.method} {req.relative_uri} from {req.remote_addr}')

    def process_response(self, req, resp, resource, req_succeeded):
        logger = logging.getLogger('falcon')
        logger.info(f'{req.method} {req.relative_uri} returned {resp.status}')
```

In the `process_request` method, we log the incoming request's method, relative URI, and remote address. In the `process_response` method, we log the outgoing response's method, relative URI, and status code.

To activate the logging middleware, add an instance of `LoggingMiddleware` to your Falcon API, along with appropriate logging configuration:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
api = falcon.API(middleware=[LoggingMiddleware()])
```

Now, every request and response will be logged with the provided logging level, giving you valuable insights into your Falcon application's activity.

## Conclusion

Custom error handling and logging are essential for building robust and maintainable Falcon applications. By implementing custom error handling, you can provide more meaningful error messages to clients. With logging, you can track the flow of requests and responses in your application. Combining both features ensures a better user experience and simplifies debugging.
