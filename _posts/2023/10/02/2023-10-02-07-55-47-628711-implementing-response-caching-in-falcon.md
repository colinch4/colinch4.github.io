Caching is a technique that can greatly improve the performance and responsiveness of web applications. It allows the server to store and reuse previously generated responses for future requests, reducing the need to generate the same response repeatedly.

In Falcon, a lightweight Python web framework, implementing response caching is straightforward. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, import the necessary modules:

```python
import falcon
from falcon_caching.middleware import FalconCacheMiddleware
```

2. Next, create an instance of the `FalconCacheMiddleware` class and pass it to the Falcon `API` constructor:

```python
cache_middleware = FalconCacheMiddleware()
api = falcon.API(middleware=[cache_middleware])
```

3. Now, let's define a resource that we want to cache. Create a class that inherits from `falcon.Resource` and use the `@falcon_cache.cache_response()` decorator to specify the caching rules:

```python
from falcon_caching import cache_response

class MyResource:

    @cache_response(max_age=3600)  # Cache the response for 1 hour
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        resp.media = {'message': 'Hello, Falcon!'}
```

4. Finally, add the resource to the Falcon API:

```python
api.add_route('/hello', MyResource())
```

With these steps in place, Falcon will now automatically cache the response of the `on_get` method of `MyResource` for subsequent requests. The cache will be valid for 1 hour (`max_age` value specified in the `cache_response` decorator).

By implementing response caching in Falcon, you can significantly improve the performance of your web application by reducing the workload on the server and minimizing the response time for repeated requests.
