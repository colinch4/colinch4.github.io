Pagination is an essential feature in building scalable and user-friendly web applications. It allows us to handle large datasets by dividing them into smaller, more manageable portions. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pagination using the limit-offset pagination technique in Falcon, a lightweight Python web framework.

### What is Limit-Offset Pagination?

Limit-Offset pagination is a pagination technique that involves specifying the number of items to return (limit) and the starting point (offset) in the dataset. This approach allows us to retrieve a specific range of data based on the provided limits and offsets.

### Setting Up the Project

Before we dive into implementing pagination, let's set up a Falcon project. Start by creating a new virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install falcon
```

Next, create a new Python file named `app.py` and import the required modules:

```python
import falcon

from falcon.media.validators import jsonschema
from falcon import Request, Response, API, status
```

### Implementing Pagination

To implement pagination with limit-offset pagination in Falcon, we need to handle two endpoints: one for fetching the paginated data and another for receiving the pagination parameters.

Let's create a simple example where we have a list of users, and we want to paginate through them.

First, define a list of users as dummy data in the `app.py` file:

```python
users = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'John Doe'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Jane Smith'},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'Alex Johnson'},
    # ... add more users
]
```

Next, define a Falcon resource class for handling the user endpoint:

```python
class UserResource:
    def on_get(self, req: Request, resp: Response):
        limit = req.params.get('limit', 10)  # default limit is 10
        offset = req.params.get('offset', 0)

        try:
            limit = int(limit)
            offset = int(offset)
        except ValueError:
            resp.status = status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST
            resp.media = {'message': 'Invalid limit or offset parameter'}
            return

        paginated_users = users[offset:offset + limit]
        resp.media = paginated_users
        resp.status = status.HTTP_200_OK
```

Here, we retrieve the `limit` and `offset` parameters from the query string of the request. The default limit is set to 10 if no value is provided. We convert the parameters to integers and handle any potential value errors.

Finally, we perform the pagination logic by slicing the `users` list based on the provided limit and offset. The resulting paginated data is then set as the response media, and the status code is set to `200 OK`.

Now, let's define the Falcon API and add the `UserResource` as a route:

```python
app = API()
app.add_route('/users', UserResource())
```

### Testing Pagination

To test the pagination implementation, start the Falcon server by running the `app.py` script:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

Open your web browser or use your preferred API testing tool and make a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/users` with the desired `limit` and `offset` parameters. For example:

```
GET /users?limit=5&offset=10
```

You should receive a response containing the paginated user data as per your specified limit and offset.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement pagination with limit-offset pagination in Falcon. By incorporating pagination into your web application, you can efficiently handle large datasets and enhance the user experience. Falcon's simplicity and flexibility make it an ideal choice for building scalable web applications with pagination support.
