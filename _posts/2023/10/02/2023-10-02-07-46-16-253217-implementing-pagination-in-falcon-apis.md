Pagination is an essential feature in modern APIs that allows clients to retrieve a large set of data in multiple smaller chunks or pages. Falcon, a lightweight Python web framework, provides a flexible and straightforward approach to implement pagination in your APIs.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pagination in Falcon APIs using query parameters and demonstrate a simple example.

## Adding Pagination Support to an API Endpoint

To implement pagination, we can leverage query parameters to control the number of results per page and the current page number.

Let's start by adding two query parameters to our API endpoint:

```python
import falcon

class MyResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
    
        # Extract pagination parameters
        limit = req.get_param_as_int('limit') or 10
        page = req.get_param_as_int('page') or 1
        
        # Perform pagination logic
        results = self.get_results_from_database()
        paginated_results = self.paginate_results(results, page, limit)
        
        resp.media = paginated_results
```

In the above example, we defined a Falcon resource called `MyResource` with an `on_get` method, which will handle GET requests to our API endpoint.

Inside the `on_get` method, we obtain the `limit` and `page` query parameters using the `req.get_param_as_int()` method. If the parameters are not provided, we default to `10` for `limit` and `1` for `page`.

After extracting the pagination parameters, we can perform our desired logic to retrieve the results from the database. In this case, we assume the existence of `get_results_from_database()` and `paginate_results()` methods.

Finally, we set the response media to the `paginated_results` and Falcon will automatically serialize it to the appropriate format.

## Testing the Pagination

To test our pagination implementation, we can make GET requests to our API endpoint. For example, to retrieve 10 results from the second page, we would call:

```
GET /api/my-resource?limit=10&page=2
```

## Conclusion

By adding simple query parameters to our Falcon API endpoint, we can easily implement pagination and allow clients to retrieve large result sets in a controlled manner. Pagination enhances the performance and usability of APIs, making them more scalable and user-friendly.

Remember to adapt this implementation to your specific needs, such as integrating it with your database or ORM. Happy coding!
