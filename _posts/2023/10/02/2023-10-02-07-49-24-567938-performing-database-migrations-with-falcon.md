Migrating a database is a crucial task when developing web applications. It involves modifying the structure of the database schema to accommodate new features, changes, or bug fixes. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform database migrations with Falcon, a versatile and lightweight Python web framework.

## Setting up the Database

Before we dive into database migration, let's set up the initial database configuration. Falcon supports various database backends such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, among others. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that we are using SQLite.

To begin, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install falcon peewee
```

Next, create a Python file, `app.py`, and import the necessary modules:

```python
import falcon
from peewee import *

# Configure and connect to the database
db = SqliteDatabase('my_database.db')

# Define your Peewee models here
```

## Defining Peewee Models

Peewee is a simple yet powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library that works seamlessly with Falcon. Let's create a sample model, `User`, to demonstrate the migration process. Open `app.py` and modify it as follows:

```python
class User(Model):
    username = CharField()
    email = CharField()

    class Meta:
        database = db
```

## Performing Database Migrations

To perform a migration, we need to create a migration script that alters the database schema. We will use the `peewee` command-line tool to simplify this process.

First, install `peewee` globally using pip:

```bash
pip install peewee
```

Now, create a migration script file named `migrate.py`. Add the following code to it:

```python
from peewee import *
from app import db, User

# Define your migration logic here
```

Inside the migration script, we can define our migration logic. Let's say we want to add a new field, `age`, to the `User` model. We can achieve this by creating a new migration method as shown:

```python
def add_age_field():
    with db.atomic():
        db.create_tables([User])  # Create tables if they don't exist
        db.create_table_migrator(User).add_column('age', IntegerField(null=True))
        print('Migration completed successfully.')
```

## Running Database Migrations

To execute the migration script, we need to invoke it from the command line. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python migrate.py add_age_field
```

This will execute the `add_age_field` method defined in the migration script. It will create the `age` field in the `User` table, and print a success message upon completion.

Database migrations are crucial when working on evolving applications. They allow us to manage schema changes efficiently and ensure data integrity. By following this guide, you now have a basic understanding of how to perform database migrations with Falcon and Peewee.
