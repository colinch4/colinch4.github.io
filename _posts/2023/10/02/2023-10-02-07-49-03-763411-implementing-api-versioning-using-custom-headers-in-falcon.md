API versioning is an essential aspect of any API development, allowing developers to introduce changes and improvements without breaking existing API clients. One approach to implement API versioning is by using custom headers.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement API versioning using custom headers in the Falcon web framework. Falcon is a lightweight Python web framework designed for building fast and scalable APIs.

## Why Use Custom Headers for API Versioning?

Custom headers provide a flexible way to implement API versioning. Instead of appending version numbers to URLs or using query parameters, custom headers allow developers to keep the URL structure clean and semantically meaningful.

## Implementing API Versioning in Falcon

To implement API versioning using custom headers in Falcon, we can create a middleware that checks the custom header and routes the request to the appropriate version of the API.

First, let's create the custom middleware class:

```python
import falcon

class APIMiddleware:
    def process_resource(self, req, resp, resource, params):
        version = req.get_header('X-API-Version')
        if version:
            req.context['api_version'] = version
        else:
            # Set the default version if header is not present
            req.context['api_version'] = 'v1'
```

In the `process_resource` method, we retrieve the value of the `X-API-Version` header from the request. If the header is present, we store its value in the `api_version` context attribute. If the header is not found, we set a default version (in this case, `v1`).

To use this middleware in our Falcon application, we need to add it to our `API` instance:

```python
import falcon

api = falcon.API(middleware=[APIMiddleware()])
```

Now, when a request comes in, the middleware will extract the API version from the `X-API-Version` header and store it in the request context. We can then use this context attribute in our resource classes to handle version-specific behaviors.

Let's illustrate this with an example resource class:

```python
import falcon

class HelloWorldResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        api_version = req.context['api_version']
        resp.media = {'message': f"Hello World! API version: {api_version}"}
```

In the `on_get` method, we retrieve the API version from the request context and include it in the response message.

By using this approach, clients can specify the desired API version by setting the `X-API-Version` header in their requests. The Falcon middleware will ensure that the appropriate version of the API is served based on the header value.

## Wrapping Up

Implementing API versioning is crucial to provide a smooth upgrade path for API clients. Using custom headers is a flexible approach to achieve API versioning, allowing for cleaner URL structures. In Falcon, we can employ a middleware to handle the custom header and route requests to the appropriate API version.

By following this approach, you can effectively version your Falcon-based API and provide a seamless experience to your API consumers.
