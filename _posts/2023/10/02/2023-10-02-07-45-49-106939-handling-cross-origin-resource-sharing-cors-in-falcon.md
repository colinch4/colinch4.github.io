Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows requests from one domain to access resources on another domain. By default, browsers enforce a same-origin policy to prevent web pages from making cross-origin requests. CORS provides a way to relax this policy and enable controlled access to resources from different origins.

In this post, we'll explore how to handle CORS in Falcon, a lightweight Python web framework.

## Understanding CORS

Before we dive into handling CORS in Falcon, let's briefly understand how CORS works. When a web browser makes a cross-origin request, it sends an `OPTIONS` preflight request to the server to check if the server is willing to accept the actual request. The server responds with appropriate CORS headers to indicate whether the request is allowed or not.

## Enabling CORS in Falcon

Falcon provides a built-in middleware called `CORSComponent` that can be used to handle CORS in your application. To enable CORS, you need to add this middleware to your Falcon application.

First, install the `falcon-cors` package using pip:

```shell
$ pip install falcon-cors
```

Next, import the necessary modules in your Falcon application:

```python
import falcon
from falcon_cors import CORS
```

Create an instance of the `CORS` class and add it as a middleware to your Falcon application:

```python
cors = CORS(allow_all_origins=True, allow_all_headers=True, allow_all_methods=True)
app = falcon.App(middleware=[cors.middleware])
```
## Configuration Options

The `CORS` class accepts several configuration options that you can customize according to your needs. Here are some commonly used options:

- `allow_origins`: A list of allowed origins. You can specify specific domain names or use `*` to allow all origins.
- `allow_headers`: A list of allowed headers.
- `allow_methods`: A list of allowed HTTP methods.
- `expose_headers`: A list of headers that the browser is allowed to access.
- `max_age`: The maximum amount of time in seconds that the preflight request is cached.

## Conclusion

Handling CORS in Falcon is straightforward with the help of the `falcon-cors` package. By enabling CORS, you can securely allow cross-origin requests in your Falcon application.
