In this tutorial, we will explore how to create radar polar charts using Python data in Kibana. Kibana is a popular open-source data visualization tool that allows users to analyze and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. 

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running
- Python installed on your local machine
- pandas and elasticsearch Python libraries installed

### Step 1: Prepare the data

To create radar polar charts in Kibana, we need to prepare the data in a specific format. In this example, let's assume that we have a dataset of products with their corresponding prices and ratings.

We will use Python and pandas to transform our data into the desired format. Here's an example code snippet to accomplish this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('products.csv')

# Preprocess the data
data = data.groupby('product_category').mean()

# Reset index
data.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Save the processed data to a new file
data.to_csv('processed_products.csv', index=False)
```

Ensure that your dataset is stored in a CSV file with appropriate columns (e.g., product_category, price, rating).

### Step 2: Load the data into Elasticsearch

To visualize the data in Kibana, we need to index it in Elasticsearch. Here's an example code snippet to load the processed data into Elasticsearch using the elasticsearch Python library:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from elasticsearch.helpers import bulk
import csv

# Establish a connection to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch([{'host': 'localhost', 'port': 9200}])

# Load the data from the processed CSV file
with open('processed_products.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    actions = [
        {
            "_index": "products",
            "_source": {
                "product_category": row['product_category'],
                "price": float(row['price']),
                "rating": float(row['rating'])
            }
        }
        for row in reader
    ]

# Index the data in Elasticsearch
bulk(es, actions)
```

Ensure that you have Elasticsearch running on localhost with the default port (9200).

### Step 3: Visualize the data in Kibana

1. Open Kibana in your web browser and go to the Discover tab.
2. Create an index pattern for your data by entering the index name (e.g., "products") and selecting the appropriate date field.
3. After the index pattern is created, go to the Visualize tab.
4. Click on "Create new visualization" and select "Radar Polar Chart" from the available visualization types.
5. Configure the radar polar chart by selecting the desired aggregation for the angles and values.
6. Customize the chart appearance by adjusting labels, colors, and other settings.
7. Save the visualization and add it to a dashboard for further analysis.

And there you have it! You have successfully built radar polar charts using Python data in Kibana. This can be a powerful way to visualize and explore your data in a unique and informative manner.

Don't forget to share your visualizations using the hashtags #DataVisualization and #PythonKibana.

Happy charting!
