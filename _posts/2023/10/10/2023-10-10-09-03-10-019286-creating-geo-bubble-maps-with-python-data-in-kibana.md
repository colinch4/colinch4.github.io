Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to explore, analyze, and present data in various formats. One of the key features of Kibana is its ability to create geo bubble maps, which visually represent data points on a geographical map.

In this blog post, we will walk you through the process of creating geo bubble maps using Python data in Kibana. We will use the Elasticsearch Python client library, `elasticsearch-py`, to index and retrieve data from Elasticsearch, and then visualize it in Kibana.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- An Elasticsearch and Kibana installation running locally or on a remote server.
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The `elasticsearch-py` library installed. You can install it using pip with the following command: `pip install elasticsearch`

## Installing Elasticsearch and Kibana

To install Elasticsearch and Kibana, refer to the official Elasticsearch documentation [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana) respectively. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

## Indexing geospatial data in Elasticsearch

Once you have Elasticsearch and Kibana installed, you need to index your geospatial data into Elasticsearch. In this example, let's assume you have a dataset with latitude, longitude, and a numeric value associated with each data point.

Here's an example of how you can index the data using the `elasticsearch-py` library:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch()

# Indexing a single data point
data_point = {
    "location": {
        "lat": 40.7128,
        "lon": -74.0060
    },
    "value": 100
}

es.index(index="geodata", body=data_point)

# Indexing multiple data points
data_points = [
    {
        "location": {
            "lat": 34.0522,
            "lon": -118.2437
        },
        "value": 200
    },
    {
        "location": {
            "lat": 51.5074,
            "lon": -0.1278
        },
        "value": 150
    }
]

for data in data_points:
    es.index(index="geodata", body=data)
```

## Retrieving data with Python

To create a geo bubble map in Kibana, we need to retrieve the indexed data from Elasticsearch using Python. 

Here's an example of how you can retrieve the data using the `elasticsearch-py` library:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch()

# Retrieve all data points
res = es.search(index="geodata", size=10000)  # Increase size if needed

for doc in res['hits']['hits']:
    location = doc['_source']['location']
    value = doc['_source']['value']
    # Process the data as needed
```

## Creating a geo bubble map in Kibana

Now that we have retrieved the data with Python, we can use Kibana to create a geo bubble map visualization.

1. Open Kibana in your web browser and navigate to the **Management** tab.
2. Click on **Index Patterns** and create a new index pattern using the index name used during data indexing ("geodata" in our example).
3. Go to the **Visualize** tab and click on **Create a visualization**.
4. Choose the **Coordinate Map** visualization type.
5. Select the index pattern you created in step 2.
6. In the **Buckets** section, select **Geohash** as the aggregation and set the field to your location field.
7. In the **Metrics** section, select **Sum** as the aggregation and set the field to your value field.
8. Customize the appearance of your geo bubble map as desired and click on **Save**.
9. Finally, you can add the geo bubble map visualization to a Kibana dashboard for a comprehensive view of your data.

## Conclusion

Creating geo bubble maps with Python data in Kibana is a straightforward process that allows you to visualize geospatial data in an interactive and meaningful way. By leveraging the power of Python and the Elasticsearch Python client library, you can index and retrieve data from Elasticsearch and transform it into visually appealing geo bubble maps in Kibana.
