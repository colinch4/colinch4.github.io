![Bar-in-Bar Treemap](https://example.com/bar-in-bar-treemap.png)

Treemaps are a type of visualization that represent hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles. While Kibana provides several built-in visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, it does not have native support for treemaps. However, with a little bit of creativity and Python, we can generate bar-in-bar treemaps using the data stored in Kibana.

In this tech blog post, we will explore how to build bar-in-bar treemaps using Python data and visualize it in Kibana.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- A working installation of Python
- Kibana installed and running
- Python client library for Elasticsearch, e.g., `elasticsearch-py`

## Connecting Python to Kibana
The first step is to establish a connection between Python and Kibana. We can achieve this by using the `elasticsearch-py` library, which provides a Python interface to interact with Elasticsearch, the underlying data store of Kibana.

To connect Python to Kibana, install the `elasticsearch-py` library using pip:

```python
pip install elasticsearch
```

Once installed, you can establish a connection to Kibana in your Python code:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch('http://localhost:9200')
```

Make sure to update the URL and port to match your Kibana configuration.

## Getting Data from Kibana
Once the connection is established, we can retrieve the necessary data from Kibana. This depends on the specific data you want to visualize in the treemap.

Using Elasticsearch's search API, you can construct a query to retrieve the relevant data from Kibana:

```python
query = {
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    }
}

result = es.search(index='your-index-name', body=query, size=1000)
```

Here, `your-index-name` should be replaced with the name of your index in Elasticsearch.

## Creating the Bar-in-Bar Treemap
To create the bar-in-bar treemap, we need to process the data retrieved from Kibana and generate the necessary nested rectangles.

The Python library `squarify` is useful for creating treemaps by allocating space to rectangles based on their values. Install it by running:

```python
pip install squarify
```

Once installed, you can use it in your code to generate the treemap:

```python
import squarify

# Prepare data for squarify
values = [item['_source']['value'] for item in result['hits']['hits']]
labels = [item['_source']['label'] for item in result['hits']['hits']]

# Generate treemap
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
colors = plt.cm.gist_rainbow(np.linspace(0, 1, len(result['hits']['hits'])))
squarify.plot(sizes=values, label=labels, alpha=0.8, color=colors)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

## Visualizing the Treemap in Kibana
Once you have generated the bar-in-bar treemap using Python, you can save it as an image and upload it to Kibana for visualization.

To save the treemap as an image, use the `savefig` function from Matplotlib:

```python
fig.savefig('treemap.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

Now, in Kibana's dashboard, you can use the "Image" visualization type to display the treemap. Add a new visualization of type "Image" and specify the path to the saved treemap image (`treemap.png`).

## Conclusion
Although Kibana does not have built-in support for treemaps, we can leverage Python and the power of Elasticsearch to generate bar-in-bar treemaps from Kibana data. By connecting Python to Kibana, retrieving data, and using the `squarify` library, we can create visually appealing treemaps and showcase them in Kibana's dashboards.

By utilizing these techniques, you can enhance your data visualization capabilities in Kibana and provide deeper insights into your hierarchical data.
