Deviation charts are a powerful visual tool for analyzing data trends and identifying outliers. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build deviation charts using Python data in Kibana. Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool that works in conjunction with Elasticsearch.

## 1. Introduction

Deviation charts, also known as range charts, are graphical representations of data that show the variation or deviation from an expected value. They are commonly used in statistical analysis and quality control applications.

With Kibana, we can easily create deviation charts using Python data stored in Elasticsearch. Python provides various libraries for data manipulation and analysis, such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, which we can use to generate the necessary data for our charts.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running

## 3. Setting up Elasticsearch and Kibana

To set up Elasticsearch and Kibana, follow the official documentation provided by Elastic. Once you have both Elasticsearch and Kibana running, make sure they are accessible through their respective URLs.

## 4. Loading Python data into Elasticsearch

First, let's load our Python data into Elasticsearch. We can use the Elasticsearch Python client library, `elasticsearch`, to achieve this.

Install `elasticsearch` using pip:

```
pip install elasticsearch
```

Next, let's assume we have a Python script that processes some data and retrieves a Pandas DataFrame. We can convert this DataFrame into JSON documents and index them into Elasticsearch for visualization in Kibana.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
import pandas as pd

# Create Elasticsearch client
es = Elasticsearch()

# Assuming we have a Pandas DataFrame called 'data'
# Convert DataFrame to JSON documents
documents = data.to_dict(orient='records')

# Index the documents into Elasticsearch
for doc in documents:
    es.index(index='my_index', body=doc)
```

Replace `'my_index'` with the desired index name in Elasticsearch.

## 5. Creating a Deviation Chart in Kibana

Once our Python data is indexed into Elasticsearch, we can proceed to create a deviation chart in Kibana. 

1. Open Kibana in your preferred web browser and navigate to the "Visualize" tab.

2. Click on the "Create Visualization" button and choose the "Line Chart" visualization.

3. In the "Data" tab, select your Elasticsearch index and configure the x-axis and y-axis as per your data.

4. Now, let's add the deviation line to the chart. In the "Metrics & Axes" tab, click on the "Add Metric" button.

5. Choose the "Extended Stats" aggregation and select the field or metric you want to calculate the deviation for.

6. Scroll down to the "Panel Options" section and enable the "Show Deviation Line" option.

7. Configure any additional settings or customizations for your chart.

8. Once you have configured the chart to your liking, click on the "Save" button to save the visualization.

## 6. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build deviation charts using Python data in Kibana. By combining the power of Python libraries like Pandas with Elasticsearch and Kibana, we can easily visualize and analyze our data in a meaningful way. This allows us to identify outliers, detect trends, and gain valuable insights from our data.
