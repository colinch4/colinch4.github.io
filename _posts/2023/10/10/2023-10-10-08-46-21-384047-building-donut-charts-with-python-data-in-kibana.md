Donut charts are a great way to visually represent data and show the distribution of different categories within a dataset. In this blog post, we will explore how to build donut charts using Python data in Kibana.

## Introduction
Kibana is an open-source data visualization platform that allows you to explore, analyze, and visualize your data. It provides a powerful interface for creating different types of visualizations, including donut charts. Donut charts display data in a circular format, with each category represented as a slice of the donut.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Python installed on your system
2. Elasticsearch and Kibana up and running

## Getting Started
To get started, we need to install the necessary libraries. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```python
pip install elasticsearch
```

Next, let's create a Python script to connect to Elasticsearch and fetch some data. Here's an example using the Elasticsearch Python library:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch([{'host': 'localhost', 'port': 9200}])

# Search for data
results = es.search(index='your_index', body={ 'query': { 'match_all': {} } })

# Process and analyze the results
# ...your code here...
```

Make sure to replace `'localhost'` and `9200` with the appropriate Elasticsearch host and port.

## Building the Donut Chart
Once we have the data from Elasticsearch, we can use it to build the donut chart in Kibana. Follow these steps:

1. Open Kibana in your web browser and go to the "Visualize" tab.
2. Click on "Create a new visualization" and select "Pie chart" as the visualization type.
3. In the "Buckets" section, choose "Split Slices" and select your data field from Elasticsearch for the slice splits.
4. Click on the "Donut" option under "Chart type" to convert the pie chart into a donut chart.
5. Customize the labels, colors, and other settings according to your preferences.
6. Finally, click on "Save" to save the donut chart.

## Customizing the Donut Chart
Kibana provides various options for customizing the appearance of your donut chart. You can:

- Change the colors of the slices to make them more visually appealing.
- Add labels to the slices to display the category names or values.
- Customize the size, border, and spacing of the chart to fit your needs.
- Apply filters to display specific subsets of data in the donut chart.

Experiment with different settings and configurations to create the perfect donut chart for your data.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to build donut charts using Python data in Kibana. Donut charts are an effective way of visualizing data and understanding the distribution of different categories. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can create beautiful and informative donut charts to analyze your data in Kibana.
