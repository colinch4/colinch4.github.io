Bar-in-bar charts are a popular choice when visualizing data that has nested or hierarchical categories. These charts allow you to display multiple levels of categories in a single chart, making it easier to compare and analyze data. In this blog post, we will explore how to build bar-in-bar charts using Python data in Kibana.

## What is Kibana?

Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool designed specifically for Elasticsearch. It allows users to create interactive dashboards, visualizations, and graphs to analyze and monitor data stored in Elasticsearch. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Kibana is widely used for data visualization and analysis.

## Setting up Python data in Kibana

To get started, we need to set up a connection between Python and Kibana. First, make sure you have Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running on your system. You can follow the official documentation for installation instructions.

Once Elasticsearch and Kibana are set up, we can use the Elasticsearch Python library (elasticsearch-py) to interact with Elasticsearch. You can install the library using pip:

```python
pip install elasticsearch
```

Next, we need to establish a connection to Elasticsearch in our Python script:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch('http://localhost:9200')
```

Now, we are ready to retrieve data from Elasticsearch and visualize it in Kibana.

## Creating a Bar-in-Bar chart

To create a bar-in-bar chart in Kibana, we need to define a nested aggregation in our Elasticsearch query. This nested aggregation will allow us to group data by multiple levels of categories.

Here is an example of how to create a bar-in-bar chart using the Elasticsearch Python library:

```python
# Define the Elasticsearch query with nested aggregation
query = {
  "aggs": {
    "outer_aggregation": {
      "terms": { "field": "outer_category" },
      "aggs": {
        "inner_aggregation": {
          "terms": { "field": "inner_category" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Execute the query
response = es.search(index='my_index', body=query)

# Process and visualize the data (e.g., using Matplotlib or another plotting library)
```

In this example, we define an outer aggregation to group data by the outer category and an inner aggregation to group data by the inner category. The resulting data can be processed and visualized using various Python plotting libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Customizing the chart

Once the data is visualized in Kibana, you can customize the appearance of the bar-in-bar chart. Kibana offers a wide range of options to modify the chart's layout, colors, labels, and other visual properties. You can experiment with different settings to create the desired visualization.

## Conclusion

Bar-in-bar charts are a powerful way to visualize hierarchical data in a single chart. By leveraging the Elasticsearch Python library and Kibana's visualization capabilities, we can easily build and customize bar-in-bar charts using Python data. This allows us to gain valuable insights and effectively communicate our data analysis findings.
