Bullet charts are an effective visualization method to represent data in a compact and informative way. They are commonly used to compare actual values against target values or to track progress towards goals. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build vertical bullet charts using Python data in Kibana.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Kibana is an open-source data visualization tool that works seamlessly with Elasticsearch. It provides a user-friendly interface to create interactive dashboards and visualizations based on Elasticsearch data. While Kibana offers various pre-built visualization types, we can extend its capabilities by incorporating Python scripts to create custom visualizations like vertical bullet charts.

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Python installed on your system
- Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running
- Basic understanding of Python and Kibana

## Setting up Kibana <a name="setting-up-kibana"></a>

Before we dive into building the bullet chart, let's ensure that Kibana is properly set up. Access Kibana by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5601`. Once you have access to the Kibana dashboard, ensure that you have a suitable index with relevant data for visualization.

## Preparing Python Data <a name="preparing-python-data"></a>

To create a vertical bullet chart, we first need to prepare the data in Python and index it into Elasticsearch.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch()

# Example data
chart_data = [
    {"category": "Sales", "actual": 70, "target": 80},
    {"category": "Expenses", "actual": 40, "target": 30},
    {"category": "Profit", "actual": 20, "target": 25}
]

# Indexing data into Elasticsearch
for data in chart_data:
    es.index(index='bullet-chart', body=data)
```

In the code snippet above, we are using the `elasticsearch` Python library to interact with Elasticsearch. We define a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a data point with the category, actual value, and target value. We then index each data point into Elasticsearch.

Now that we have our data indexed in Elasticsearch, let's create a vertical bullet chart in Kibana:

1. Open the Kibana dashboard and navigate to the **Visualize** tab.
2. Click on the **Create a visualization** button.
3. Select the **Coordinate Map** visualization type.
4. In the **Data** tab, choose the appropriate index.
5. In the **Metrics** section, select the **Vertical Bar** chart style.
6. Set the Y-axis to the actual value and the X-axis to the category.
7. Under the "Buckets" section, add a new bucket of type **Y-axis**.
8. In the **Aggregation** dropdown, select the "Target" field.
9. Customize the appearance, labels, and colors as desired.
10. Click **Save** to save and display the completed bullet chart.

With these steps, you have created a vertical bullet chart in Kibana representing your Python data.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this tutorial, we have explored how to build vertical bullet charts using Python data in Kibana. By leveraging Python and Elasticsearch, we can create custom visualizations that effectively communicate data insights. Bullet charts are a powerful tool for visually representing progress or comparisons, allowing you to present your data in a concise and meaningful way.
