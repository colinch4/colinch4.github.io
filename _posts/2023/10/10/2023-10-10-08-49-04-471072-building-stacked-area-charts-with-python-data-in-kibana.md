## Introduction to Stacked Area Charts

A stacked area chart is a variation of the line chart where the filled area between consecutive lines represents the cumulative total of the categories being plotted. Each category is represented by a different color, and the sum of all categories at a specific point on the x-axis represents the total value.

## Preparing the Data

To build a stacked area chart in Kibana, we need data in the appropriate format. The data should be in a tabular form with a time-based column and separate columns for each category we want to display.

Let's assume we have a dataset in Python with the following structure:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03'],
    'Category A': [10, 20, 15],
    'Category B': [5, 10, 12],
    'Category C': [8, 5, 9]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
```

In this example, we have three categories (A, B, and C) and their corresponding values for three different dates.

## Setting Up Kibana

Before we proceed, make sure you have Kibana installed and running. Kibana is an open-source data visualization tool that works seamlessly with Elasticsearch, making it easy to explore and visualize data.

Once you have Kibana set up, you can import your Python dataset into Elasticsearch by converting it to a suitable format such as JSON or CSV.

## Creating a Stacked Area Chart

To create a stacked area chart in Kibana:

1. Open Kibana in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Visualize" tab in the left sidebar.
3. Click on the "Create a visualization" button.
4. Select the "Area chart" visualization type.
5. Choose the appropriate index pattern and time field for your data.
6. Add a new sub-bucket aggregation of type "Terms" and choose the category field.
7. Customize the settings and appearance of your stacked area chart, such as color scheme, legend, and axis labels.
8. Click the "Save" button to save your visualization.

## Customizing the Stacked Area Chart

Kibana provides various customization options to enhance your stacked area chart. You can modify the colors, labels, and legends to make your chart more visually appealing and informative.

Additionally, you can apply filters, add tooltips, and tweak the scale of the x and y axes to better represent your data.

## Conclusion

Stacked area charts are a powerful way to visualize the composition of multiple categories over time or any continuous scale. With Python data in Kibana, you can create stunning stacked area charts to gain insights from your data.

By following the above steps, you can easily build and customize stacked area charts in Kibana, allowing you to effectively communicate your data visually.
