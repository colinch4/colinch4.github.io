Data visualization is a crucial aspect of data analysis and interpretation. When working with Python, you may find yourself needing to create stacked bar percentage charts to represent data in a visually compelling way. In this blog post, we will explore how to create such charts using Python data in Kibana.

## Introduction
Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool that allows you to explore, analyze, and visualize data using a web interface. It provides a range of visualization options, including stacked bar charts, which are useful for comparing categories of data across different groups.

Prerequisites:
- Python installed on your system
- Kibana set up and running

## Step 1: Prepare the Data
To create stacked bar percentage charts in Kibana, you need to prepare your data in a suitable format. Ensure that your data is properly structured and organized with the necessary attributes and categories.

## Step 2: Connect Python to Kibana
To interact with Kibana using Python, you can use the Elasticsearch Python client library, `elasticsearch-py`. Install the library using `pip`:

```python
pip install elasticsearch
```

After installing the library, you can establish a connection to your Kibana instance:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch('http://localhost:9200')
```

## Step 3: Create Stacked Bar Percentage Charts
To create stacked bar percentage charts in Kibana using Python data, you need to send the data to Elasticsearch. Here's an example of how you can create a stacked bar percentage chart using the `elasticsearch-py` library:

```python
data = {
    "aggs": {
        "group_by_category": {
            "terms": {
                "field": "category.keyword"
            },
            "aggs": {
                "group_by_group": {
                    "terms": {
                        "field": "group.keyword"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

response = es.search(index="your_index", body=data)

# Process the response to extract the required data
```

The above code sends a search request to Elasticsearch with an aggregation query to group the data by category and further by group. You can customize the aggregation query based on your data structure and requirements.

After retrieving the response, you can process it to extract the necessary data and visualize it in Kibana. Refer to the Kibana documentation for the specific steps to create a stacked bar percentage chart based on your data.

## Conclusion
Creating stacked bar percentage charts using Python data in Kibana is a powerful way to visually represent and analyze data. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can harness the capabilities of Python and Kibana to generate insightful visualizations for your data analysis tasks.
