Donut bar charts are an effective way to visualize data in a circular format while maintaining the ability to compare different categories. Kibana, a popular open-source data visualization platform, offers powerful tools for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build donut bar charts with Python data in Kibana.

## Introduction
Donut bar charts provide a visually pleasing way to display data by combining the simplicity of bar charts with the informative style of pie charts. By dividing a circular shape into sections, donut bar charts allow us to compare the relative values of different categories at a glance.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

1. Python installed on your machine.
2. Kibana installed and running. You can download Kibana from the official website.

## Setting up Kibana
Once you have Kibana installed and running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5601`. This is the default URL for accessing Kibana. You should see the Kibana home page.

## Preparing Python Data
Before we can build a donut bar chart in Kibana, we need to prepare our data in Python. We'll use a Python library to generate some random data for demonstration purposes. Here is an example code snippet to generate the data:

```python
import random

categories = ['Category A', 'Category B', 'Category C', 'Category D']
data = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(len(categories))]

print(categories)
print(data)
```

In this code, we create a list of categories and generate random data values for each category. You can modify the list of categories or replace the random data generation logic with your own.

## Creating the Donut Bar Chart
Now that we have our Python data, we can proceed to create the donut bar chart in Kibana. Follow these steps:

1. Open Kibana in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Visualize" tab in the navigation menu.
3. Click on the "Create a visualization" button.
4. Select the "Donut Chart" visualization type.
5. Configure the data source to use your Python data. This will depend on your specific setup, but you will typically need to connect Kibana to your data source or import the data into Kibana.

Once you have configured the data source, Kibana will generate the donut bar chart based on your Python data. You can further customize the chart to suit your needs, as explained in the next section.

## Customizing the Donut Bar Chart
Kibana provides various customization options for your donut bar chart. You can adjust the colors, labels, tooltips, and other visual elements to enhance the chart's appearance and readability.

To customize your donut bar chart, follow these steps:

1. Select the visualization in Kibana.
2. Click on the "Options" tab.
3. Modify the options according to your preferences.
4. Preview the changes to see the updated chart.
5. Save the visualization when you are satisfied with the customization.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to build donut bar charts with Python data in Kibana. By leveraging Kibana's visualization capabilities, we can create interactive and visually appealing donut bar charts to effectively communicate data insights. Experiment with different settings and data sources to unlock the full potential of Kibana's charting features.
