Kibana is a powerful open-source data visualization tool that works seamlessly with the Elastic Stack. It allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. One of the visualization types available in Kibana is a tree map, which provides a hierarchical representation of data using nested rectangles.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to create tree maps using Python data in Kibana. We will be using the Elasticsearch Python library, `elasticsearch`, to index and search data, and the Elasticsearch High-Level Python client, `elasticsearch-dsl`, to create tree maps in Kibana.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you will need:

- Python 3 installed on your system
- Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running locally or on a server

## Step 1: Install Elasticsearch and Kibana

If you haven't already, start by installing Elasticsearch and Kibana on your system. You can download them from the [Elastic website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/).

After installation, start both Elasticsearch and Kibana services. You can find instructions specific to your operating system on the Elastic website.

## Step 2: Index Data into Elasticsearch

To create a tree map in Kibana, we first need some data to visualize. We will be using the `elasticsearch` library to index data into Elasticsearch.

First, install the `elasticsearch` library by running the following command:

```bash
pip install elasticsearch
```

Next, let's create a Python script to index data into Elasticsearch:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch()

# Create an index
es.indices.create(index='sales', ignore=400)

# Define and index sample data
data = [
    {"product": "Product A", "sales": 100},
    {"product": "Product B", "sales": 200},
    {"product": "Product C", "sales": 150},
    {"product": "Product D", "sales": 300},
]

for d in data:
    es.index(index='sales', body=d)
```

The above script connects to Elasticsearch, creates an index called "sales," and indexes sample data into it.

Run the script to index the data:

```bash
python index_data.py
```

## Step 3: Create a Tree Map in Kibana

Now that we have data indexed into Elasticsearch, let's create a tree map visualization in Kibana.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Kibana dashboard (http://localhost:5601 by default).
2. Click on the "Management" tab in the left sidebar and then click on "Index Patterns."
3. Click on the "Create index pattern" button.
4. Enter "sales" as the index pattern name and click "Next step."
5. On the next screen, select the field that contains the product names (e.g., "product") as the "Time Filter field name."
6. Click "Create index pattern" to create the index pattern.
7. Go to the "Visualize" tab in the left sidebar and click on "Create a visualization."
8. Select "Treemap" as the visualization type.
9. Choose the "sales" index pattern as the data source.
10. Define the visualization options, such as bucket aggregation (e.g., split slices by "Terms" on the "product" field), metric aggregation (e.g., sum "sales" field), and custom labels if desired.
11. Click "Apply changes" to generate the tree map visualization.
12. Customize the styling, labels, and other settings as needed.
13. Save the visualization for future use.

Congratulations! You have created a tree map visualization using Python data in Kibana. You can now explore your data hierarchy and gain insights from the nested rectangles.

## Conclusion

Kibana provides a convenient way to visualize data stored in Elasticsearch, and the ability to create tree maps allows for a hierarchical representation of data. By indexing data using the `elasticsearch` library and creating tree maps in Kibana, you can gain valuable insights into your data structure.

Remember to deploy Kibana and Elasticsearch to a production environment for real-world scenarios. Experiment with different index patterns and data sources to customize your tree maps to fit your specific needs.

Happy visualizing!
