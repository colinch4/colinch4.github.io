In this tutorial, we will learn how to build tree network radial charts using Python data in Kibana. Tree network radial charts are a type of visual representation that can effectively display hierarchical data with multiple connections. This type of chart is particularly useful when analyzing relationships between different entities or categories.

## Introduction to Kibana

Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool that works in conjunction with Elasticsearch. It allows users to analyze and visualize large datasets using various chart types, including tree network radial charts. To get started, make sure you have Kibana installed and configured with your Elasticsearch cluster.

## Preparing the Data

Before we can create our tree network radial chart, we need to prepare the data in Python. Let's assume we have a dataset that represents a hierarchical network of relationships between different categories.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = {
    'category': ['Category A', 'Category B', 'Category C', 'Category D', 'Category E'],
    'parent': ['Root', 'Category A', 'Category B', 'Category C', 'Category B']
}

# Convert data to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

In this example, we have a DataFrame with two columns: `category` and `parent`. Each row represents a category, and the `parent` column specifies the parent category of each category.

## Creating a Tree Network Radial Chart

To create a tree network radial chart in Kibana, follow these steps:

1. Open Kibana and navigate to the **Visualize** tab.
2. Click on **Create Visualization** and select **Radial Network**.
3. Select the appropriate index containing your data and click **Next**.
4. Configure the settings for your chart. Drag and drop the `category` field into the **Term** aggregation section, and the `parent` field into the **Parent** field section.
5. Customize the chart settings, such as colors and labels, to suit your needs.
6. Click on **Apply Changes** to see a preview of your chart.
7. Save your visualization for future reference.

## Customizing the Chart

Once you have created the basic tree network radial chart, you can further customize it to fit your requirements. Some possible customizations include:

- Changing the color scheme of the chart elements.
- Adjusting the size and thickness of the lines connecting the categories.
- Adding labels or tooltips to display additional information about each category.

By experimenting with the settings and options available in Kibana, you can create visually appealing and informative tree network radial charts.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build tree network radial charts using Python data in Kibana. By leveraging the power of Kibana's visualization capabilities, we can effectively analyze and present hierarchical data with multiple connections. With further customization options available, you can create visually compelling and insightful charts to explore relationships between different entities or categories. Happy charting!
