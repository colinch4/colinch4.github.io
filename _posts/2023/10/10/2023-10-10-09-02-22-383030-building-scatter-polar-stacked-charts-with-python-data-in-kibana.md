## Introduction
Scatter polar stacked charts are a type of visualization that combines the features of scatter plots and polar charts. They are particularly useful when analyzing data with multiple groupings across different angles. Using Python data with Kibana enables us to build these charts and gain deeper insights into our data.

## Setting Up the Environment
Before we begin, let's ensure that we have the necessary environment set up to work with Python data in Kibana. Make sure you have Kibana installed and running, and also have Elasticsearch running to store and retrieve the data.

## Preparing the Data
To build scatter polar stacked charts, we need to have the data in the appropriate format. Each data point should contain three components: the angle, the distance from the center, and the stacked values. We can prepare the data in Python by creating a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a data point.

```python
data = [
    {'angle': 45, 'distance': 0.5, 'values': [10, 20, 30]},
    {'angle': 90, 'distance': 0.7, 'values': [15, 25, 35]},
    {'angle': 135, 'distance': 0.9, 'values': [20, 30, 40]}
]
```

## Building Scatter Polar Stacked Charts
Once we have our data prepared, we can start building scatter polar stacked charts in Kibana. Follow these steps:

1. Open Kibana and navigate to the dashboard where you want to add the scatter polar stacked chart.
2. Click on "Add" to add a new visualization.
3. Select "Scatter" as the visualization type.
4. In the "Data" section, specify the Elasticsearch index where your data is stored.
5. In the "Buckets" section, select "Terms" and choose the field that represents the angle.
6. Add a second "Terms" bucket and select the field representing the stacked values.
7. In the "Metrics & Axes" section, select "Y-Axis" and choose the field representing the distance from the center.
8. Click on "Apply Changes" to generate the scatter polar stacked chart.

Congratulations! You have successfully built a scatter polar stacked chart using Python data in Kibana.

## Conclusion
Scatter polar stacked charts are a powerful visualization tool for analyzing data with multiple groupings and angles. By leveraging Python data in Kibana, we can easily create these charts and gain valuable insights into our data. Experiment with different data sets and configurations to unlock the full potential of scatter polar stacked charts in Kibana.
