Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize data efficiently. One popular type of chart often used in data analysis is a waterfall chart, which displays how positive and negative values contribute to a total. In this blog post, we will explore how to create waterfall stacked percentage charts using Python data in Kibana.

## 1. Introduction
Waterfall charts are useful for illustrating the transition from one value to another, showing the cumulative effect of positive and negative contributions. When stacked and represented as percentages, these charts can provide insight into the distribution of various factors within a category.

## 2. Setting up Kibana
Before we can begin visualizing data in Kibana, we need to set up the environment. Install Elasticsearch and Kibana, and make sure they are running on your local machine or server.

## 3. Importing Data
To create a waterfall stacked percentage chart, we need to have the relevant data. Import the data into Kibana by following these steps:

1. Open Kibana in your web browser.
2. Go to **Management** > **Index Patterns**.
3. Click on **Create index pattern** and select the index that contains your data.
4. In the next step, select the time filter field, if applicable.

## 4. Preparing Data in Python
To prepare the data for a waterfall stacked percentage chart, we can use Python and Pandas library. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the process:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Perform necessary data manipulation and aggregation
# ...

# Save the processed data back to a new CSV file
data.to_csv('processed_data.csv', index=False)
```

In this code snippet, we load the data from a CSV file using Pandas, perform any required data manipulation and aggregation, and then save the processed data to a new CSV file.

## 5. Visualizing Waterfall Stacked Percentage Charts in Kibana
Now that we have prepared our data, let's move on to creating the waterfall stacked percentage chart in Kibana:

1. Open Kibana and go to the **Visualize** tab.
2. Click on **Create visualization** and select the appropriate chart type (e.g., bar chart).
3. Specify the index pattern and configure the chart settings.
4. Select the appropriate field(s) for the x-axis and y-axis.
5. Configure the chart to display stacked percentages.
6. Apply any additional styling or customization to the chart.
7. Save the visualization and add it to a Kibana dashboard if desired.

By following these steps, you can create a waterfall stacked percentage chart using your prepared data in Kibana.

## Conclusion
Waterfall stacked percentage charts are a powerful visualization tool that can help analyze and understand the contribution of positive and negative values to a total. By preparing your data in Python and visualizing it in Kibana, you can gain valuable insights from your data.
