## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python installed on your machine
- Kibana server up and running
- Prior knowledge of Python and Kibana

## Installing and Configuring Kibana
If you haven't already installed Kibana, follow the official documentation to download and configure it. Make sure the Kibana server is running before proceeding to the next steps.

## Preparing Your Python Data
To prepare your Python data for visualization in Kibana, you need to convert it into an appropriate format such as JSON or CSV. Make sure your data includes categorical variables that you want to visualize in the donut bar stacked charts. You can use libraries like pandas to manipulate and transform your data as needed.

## Indexing Python Data in Kibana
Next, you need to index your Python data in Kibana. Follow these steps to index your data:
1. Open the Kibana web interface in your browser.
2. Go to the Management tab and click on the Index Patterns option.
3. Click on the Create index pattern button.
4. Specify the index pattern and select the relevant time field if applicable.
5. Choose the field mapping for each field in your Python data.
6. Review the index pattern details and click on the Create index pattern button.

Now that your Python data is indexed in Kibana, you can proceed to create visualizations.

## Creating Donut Bar Stacked Charts in Kibana
To create donut bar stacked charts in Kibana, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Visualize tab in Kibana.
2. Click on the Create new visualization button.
3. Select the type of visualization as Donut Chart.
4. Choose the index pattern and the relevant fields for your chart.
5. Customize the appearance and settings of your chart.
6. Save the visualization and give it a meaningful name.

You have successfully created a donut bar stacked chart using Python data in Kibana. You can further enhance your visualization by adding filters, aggregations, and other interactive features supported by Kibana.

In conclusion, donut bar stacked charts offer a compelling way to display categorical data with multiple levels of hierarchy. By leveraging Kibana's visualization capabilities and Python's data processing capabilities, you can create insightful visualizations to better understand your data. Give it a try and unlock the power of visual analytics with donut bar stacked charts in Kibana!
