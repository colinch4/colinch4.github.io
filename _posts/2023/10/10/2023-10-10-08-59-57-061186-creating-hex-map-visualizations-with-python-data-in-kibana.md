In data visualization, hex maps have gained popularity due to their ability to display data in a visually compelling and easy-to-understand format. Hex maps use hexagonal shapes to represent data points, allowing for efficient utilization of space and improved readability compared to traditional choropleth maps.

If you are working with Python and have your data stored in Elasticsearch, you can leverage the power of Kibana to create stunning hex map visualizations. Kibana is a popular data exploration and visualization tool that integrates seamlessly with Elasticsearch.

In this blog post, we will walk through the process of creating hex map visualizations using Python data in Kibana.

### Background

Hex maps are especially useful when working with geospatial data or when you want to display data points on a map-like layout. They provide a more balanced representation of geographical areas compared to traditional maps with irregularly shaped polygons (like states or countries).

With its powerful data aggregation and visualization capabilities, Kibana can help us create hex map visualizations from Python data stored in Elasticsearch. We can even customize the hex map layout and coloring based on our specific needs.

### Requirements

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Python installed on your system
- Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and configured
- Python Elasticsearch library (`elasticsearch` and `elasticsearch_dsl`)

### Setting up Elasticsearch and Kibana

Before we start, ensure that Elasticsearch and Kibana are up and running on your local machine or server. You can find detailed installation instructions on the official Elasticsearch and Kibana websites.

### Preparing the Data

To create a hex map visualization, you need input data that contains the geospatial information you want to display. In this example, let's assume we have a dataset containing cities and their corresponding population.

1. Create a new Python script.
2. Import the Elasticsearch library and create a connection to your Elasticsearch instance.
```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch("localhost:9200")
```
3. Prepare your data in a suitable format. For this example, let's assume we have a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a city and its population.
```python
data = [
    {"city": "New York", "population": 8537673, "latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060},
    {"city": "Los Angeles", "population": 3979576, "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.2437},
    {"city": "Chicago", "population": 2705994, "latitude": 41.8781, "longitude": -87.6298},
    # more city data...
]
```
4. Iterate over your data and index it in Elasticsearch.
```python
for entry in data:
    es.index(index="cities", body=entry)
```

### Creating a Hex Map Visualization in Kibana

1. Open your Kibana instance in a web browser.
2. Go to the **Visualize** tab and click on **Create a visualization**.
3. Select the **Tile Map** visualization type.
4. In the **Select index pattern** dropdown, choose the index pattern that corresponds to your indexed data (e.g., `cities`).
5. Configure the **Buckets** and **Metrics** for your hex map visualization. For example, you can choose to aggregate the data by location (latitude and longitude) and visualize the sum of population in each hexagonal tile.
6. Customize the hex map layout and color scheme to your preference.
7. Click on **Save** and give your visualization a meaningful name.

### Customizing the Hex Map

Kibana provides various customization options to enhance your hex map visualization:

- Adjusting the size, color, and opacity of hexagonal tiles
- Adding tooltips to display detailed information on hover
- Incorporating additional data layers (e.g., borders, landmarks)
- Applying filters to include or exclude specific data points

Experiment with these options to effectively convey insights from your data.

### Conclusion

Hex map visualizations offer a powerful way to represent data points in a visually appealing and informative manner. By combining Python data and Elasticsearch with Kibana, you can create beautiful hex map visualizations that help you gain meaningful insights from your data.

In this blog post, we have covered the basics of creating hex map visualizations using Python data in Kibana. Explore further to unlock the full potential of Kibana's data visualization capabilities.
