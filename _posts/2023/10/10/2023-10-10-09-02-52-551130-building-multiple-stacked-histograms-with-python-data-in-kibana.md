## Introduction

Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool that allows you to explore, analyze, and visualize your data stored in Elasticsearch. One of the key features of Kibana is its ability to create histograms, which provide a visual representation of the distribution of your data.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to build multiple stacked histograms using Python data in Kibana. We will leverage the Elasticsearch Python library to index data into Elasticsearch, and then use Kibana to create stacked histograms based on this data.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your machine
- Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running

## Step 1: Indexing Python Data into Elasticsearch

First, we need to index our Python data into Elasticsearch. We will use the Elasticsearch Python library for this purpose. Here's an example code snippet to index data into Elasticsearch:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch()

# Define the index name
index_name = "my_data_index"

# Define the document mapping
document_mapping = {
    "properties": {
        "category": {"type": "keyword"},
        "value": {"type": "integer"},
    }
}

# Create the index with the defined mapping
es.indices.create(index=index_name, body={"mappings": document_mapping})

# Index the data
data = [
    {"category": "A", "value": 10},
    {"category": "B", "value": 20},
    {"category": "A", "value": 15},
    {"category": "B", "value": 25},
    # Add more data here...
]

for doc in data:
    es.index(index=index_name, body=doc)
```

Make sure to customize the `index_name`, `document_mapping`, and the `data` list according to your requirements.

## Step 2: Creating Multiple Stacked Histograms in Kibana

Once the data is indexed into Elasticsearch, we can proceed to create multiple stacked histograms in Kibana. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open Kibana in your web browser and go to the **Management** tab.
2. Click on **Index Patterns** and create a new index pattern using the index name you defined in the previous step.
3. Go to the **Visualize** tab and click on **Create a Visualization**.
4. Select the **Vertical Bar Chart** visualization type.
5. In the **Metrics** panel, choose **Y-Axis** as the aggregation and select **Sum** as the aggregation function. Choose the field you want to plot on the y-axis (e.g., the "value" field in our example).
6. In the **Buckets** panel, choose **X-Axis** as the aggregation and select **Terms** as the aggregation function. Choose the field you want to group by on the x-axis (e.g., the "category" field in our example).
7. Enable the **Stacked** option in the **Panel Options**.
8. Customize the other settings such as chart title, axis labels, etc. as desired.
9. Click on **Save** to save the visualization.

Repeat these steps to create multiple stacked histograms based on different fields or aggregations.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build multiple stacked histograms using Python data in Kibana. We indexed Python data into Elasticsearch using the Elasticsearch Python library and then created stacked histograms in Kibana based on this data. By visualizing our data in this way, we can gain valuable insights and better understand the distribution and patterns within our data.

Make sure to experiment with different aggregations and fields to create meaningful visualizations that suit your specific needs.
