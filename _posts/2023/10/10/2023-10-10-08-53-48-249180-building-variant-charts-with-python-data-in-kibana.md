## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:
- Python installed on your machine
- Elasticsearch and Kibana setup and running
- Elasticsearch Python client library (`elasticsearch` package) installed

## Setting up the Environment<a name="setting-up-the-environment"></a>
1. Install the Elasticsearch Python client library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install elasticsearch
   ```

2. Ensure Elasticsearch and Kibana are up and running. You can access Kibana at `http://localhost:5601`.

## Preparing Python Data<a name="preparing-python-data"></a>
Assuming you have Python data that you want to visualize in Kibana, let's start by preparing the data. Here is an example of a Python dictionary representing a list of variants and their counts:

```python
data = {
    'variant1': 100,
    'variant2': 200,
    'variant3': 150,
    'variant4': 50
}
```

## Loading Data into Elasticsearch<a name="loading-data-into-elasticsearch"></a>
To load the Python data into Elasticsearch, we need to use the Elasticsearch Python client library. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch('http://localhost:9200')

# Index the data into Elasticsearch
index_name = 'variants'
document_type = 'variant'

for variant, count in data.items():
    document = {'variant': variant, 'count': count}
    es.index(index=index_name, doc_type=document_type, body=document)
```

Make sure you have Elasticsearch running on `http://localhost:9200` and replace `index_name` and `document_type` with your desired values.

## Creating Variant Charts in Kibana<a name="creating-variant-charts-in-kibana"></a>
1. Open Kibana in your web browser and go to the Management section from the sidebar.

2. Under Index Patterns, create a new index pattern for your data.

3. Navigate to the Visualize section and create a new visualization.

4. Select the appropriate chart type for your variant data.

5. Configure the visualization by choosing the index pattern you created and selecting the desired fields and aggregations.

6. Customize the chart appearance, labels, and other settings as needed.

7. Save and preview the visualization to see the variant chart based on your Python data.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
In this tutorial, we have learned how to build variant charts using Python data in Kibana. We started by preparing the Python data and then loaded it into Elasticsearch using the Elasticsearch Python client library. Finally, we created variant charts in Kibana by selecting the appropriate chart type and configuring the visualization settings. With Kibana's powerful visualization capabilities, you can gain valuable insights from your Python data. Happy charting!
