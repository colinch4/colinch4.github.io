Kibana is a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to explore and analyze data stored in Elasticsearch. One of the visualization options in Kibana is the Bullet Map Gauge, which provides a concise way to display data using bullet graphs and geographical maps. In this tutorial, we will explore how to create bullet map gauge visualizations using Python data in Kibana.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A running instance of Elasticsearch and Kibana.
2. Python installed on your machine.
3. The Elasticsearch Python library installed (`pip install elasticsearch`).

## Step 1: Prepare the Data
To create bullet map gauge visualizations, we need to have a dataset that includes the relevant geographical information and corresponding values. In this example, let's imagine we have a Python script that collects temperature data from different cities and stores it in Elasticsearch.

## Step 2: Connect and Query Elasticsearch
To retrieve the data from Elasticsearch, we need to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster and run a query. Here's an example of how to connect to Elasticsearch, query the data, and store it in a Python variable:

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Connect to Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch()

# Define your query (e.g., get all temperature data)
query = {
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}

# Execute the query
result = es.search(index="your_index_name", body=query)

# Access the data from the query response
data = result['hits']['hits']
```

Make sure to replace `'your_index_name'` with the actual name of the Elasticsearch index where your data is stored.

## Step 3: Prepare the Visualization in Kibana
Next, log in to your Kibana instance and navigate to the Visualize tab. Click on the "Create a visualization" button and choose the "Bullet Map Gauge" visualization type.

In the configuration panel, customize the visualization according to your requirements. You can choose the field to represent the bullet range, the bullet actual, and the bullet target values. Additionally, you can select the field representing the geographical information (e.g., city names) and assign it to the `Geospatial Entity` property.

## Step 4: Load Python Data into Kibana
To load the Python data into Kibana, you can export the data from Python in a format compatible with Elasticsearch (e.g., JSON) and use the Elasticsearch Python client to bulk insert the data into the Elasticsearch index.

```python
from elasticsearch.helpers import bulk

# Prepare the bulk insert actions
actions = [
    {
        "_index": "your_index_name",
        "_source": {
            "city": "New York",
            "temperature": 25
        }
    },
    {
        "_index": "your_index_name",
        "_source": {
            "city": "London",
            "temperature": 20
        }
    }
]

# Do a bulk insert to Elasticsearch
bulk(es, actions)
```

Make sure to replace `'your_index_name'` with the actual name of the Elasticsearch index where you want to store the data. Repeat this process for all the data points you want to insert.

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can leverage Python to query and retrieve data from Elasticsearch and use it to create bullet map gauge visualizations in Kibana. This powerful combination allows you to present your data in an intuitive and visually appealing way, unlocking insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making.
