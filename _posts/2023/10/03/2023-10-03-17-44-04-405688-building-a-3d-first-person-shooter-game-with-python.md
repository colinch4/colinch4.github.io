Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for game development. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a 3D first-person shooter game using Python.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Python installed on your computer
- Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame`)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

## Steps to Build the Game

### Step 1: Setting Up the Game Window

First, we need to set up the game window. We will use the Pygame library to create the game window and handle user input. Here's the code to create the game window:

```python
import pygame

pygame.init()

# Set the width and height of the game window
width, height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption("3D FPS Game")

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    pygame.display.flip()
    
pygame.quit()
```

### Step 2: Adding Player Movement

Next, let's add basic player movement. We will use the arrow keys to move the player around the game world. Here's the code to handle player movement:

```python
import pygame

pygame.init()

# Set the width and height of the game window
width, height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption("3D FPS Game")

# Player position
player_x, player_y = width // 2, height // 2

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Player movement
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        player_x -= 5
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        player_x += 5
    if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
        player_y -= 5
    if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
        player_y += 5

    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
```

### Step 3: Adding Graphics and Controls

Now, let's add graphics and controls to our game. We will load textures for the player and the game world, and use the mouse to look around. Here's the updated code:

```python
import pygame

pygame.init()

# Set the width and height of the game window
width, height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption("3D FPS Game")

# Player position
player_x, player_y = width // 2, height // 2

# Player texture
player_texture = pygame.image.load("player.png")

# Game world texture
world_texture = pygame.image.load("world.png")

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Player movement
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        player_x -= 5
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        player_x += 5
    if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
        player_y -= 5
    if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
        player_y += 5

    # Mouse movement
    mouse_delta_x, mouse_delta_y = pygame.mouse.get_rel()

    # Rendering
    screen.blit(world_texture, (0, 0))
    screen.blit(player_texture, (player_x, player_y))
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a 3D first-person shooter game using Python. We covered setting up the game window, adding player movement, and incorporating graphics and controls. With further development, you can expand the game by adding enemies, weapons, and more advanced features.
