## Getting Started with 3D Graphics in Python

To begin working with 3D graphics in Python, we need to install the necessary libraries. One of the most commonly used libraries for 3D graphics in Python is **Pygame**, which provides a set of modules and functions for creating games and interactive applications. You can install Pygame using the following command:

```python
pip install pygame
```

Once you have Pygame installed, you can import it into your Python script and start working with 3D graphics.

## Creating a 3D Object

To create a 3D object in Python, we need to define its geometry and appearance. The geometry defines the shape and size of the object, while the appearance defines its color and texture. Let's create a simple cube as an example:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
from OpenGL.GL import *
from OpenGL.GLU import *

def draw_cube():
    vertices = [
        [1, -1, -1],
        [1, 1, -1],
        [-1, 1, -1],
        [-1, -1, -1],
        [1, -1, 1],
        [1, 1, 1],
        [-1, -1, 1],
        [-1, 1, 1]
    ]
    edges = [
        [0, 1],
        [1, 2],
        [2, 3],
        [3, 0],
        [4, 5],
        [5, 6],
        [6, 7],
        [7, 4],
        [0, 4],
        [1, 5],
        [2, 6],
        [3, 7]
    ]

    glBegin(GL_LINES)
    for edge in edges:
        for vertex in edge:
            glVertex3fv(vertices[vertex])
    glEnd()

def main():
    pygame.init()
    display = (800, 600)
    pygame.display.set_mode(display, DOUBLEBUF | OPENGL)

    gluPerspective(45, (display[0] / display[1]), 0.1, 50.0)

    glTranslatef(0.0, 0.0, -5)

    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                quit()

        glRotatef(1, 3, 1, 1)
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
        draw_cube()
        pygame.display.flip()
        pygame.time.wait(10)

main()
```

In the code above, we define the vertices and edges of the cube using 3D coordinates. We then use the Pygame and OpenGL functions to create the cube and display it on the screen. The `main()` function sets up the display, handles user input, and continuously renders the cube.
