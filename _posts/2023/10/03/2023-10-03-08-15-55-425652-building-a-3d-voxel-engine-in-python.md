## Introduction

Voxel engines have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to render 3D graphics efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a simple voxel engine using Python. We will cover the basics of creating a 3D world with voxels, rendering the scene, and implementing basic user interactions.

## Getting Started

To begin, let's set up the project structure and install the required libraries:

```python
mkdir voxel_engine
cd voxel_engine
touch main.py
pip install pyglet
```

## Creating the 3D World

In our voxel engine, we will represent the world as a grid of voxels. Each voxel will have a position and a color associated with it. We can store the voxel data in a 3D array.

```python
import numpy as np

world_size = (10, 10, 10)
world = np.zeros(world_size, dtype=int)

# Set color of voxel at position (2, 2, 2) to red
world[2, 2, 2] = 0xFF0000
```

## Rendering the Scene

To render the scene, we will use the pyglet library. We can create a window and set up the OpenGL context to enable 3D rendering.

```python
import pyglet

window = pyglet.window.Window()

@window.event
def on_draw():
    window.clear()
    # Render the world here

pyglet.app.run()
```

To render the world, we can iterate over the voxel grid and draw each voxel as a cube using OpenGL.

## User Interactions

To enable basic user interactions, such as rotating the camera or moving around the world, we can capture keyboard and mouse events using pyglet.

```python
from pyglet.window import key, mouse

@window.event
def on_key_press(symbol, modifiers):
    if symbol == key.W:
        # Move forward
    elif symbol == key.S:
        # Move backward
    elif symbol == key.A:
        # Move left
    elif symbol == key.D:
        # Move right

@window.event
def on_mouse_drag(x, y, dx, dy, buttons, modifiers):
    if buttons & mouse.LEFT:
        # Rotate camera

@window.event
def on_mouse_scroll(x, y, scroll_x, scroll_y):
    # Zoom camera
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have discussed how to build a simple 3D voxel engine in Python. We covered the basics of creating a 3D world, rendering the scene using pyglet, and implementing basic user interactions. With this foundation, you can now explore further and add more advanced features to your voxel engine. Have fun experimenting and creating amazing 3D worlds!
