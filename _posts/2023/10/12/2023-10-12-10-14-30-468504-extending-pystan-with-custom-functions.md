PyStan is a popular Python library for Bayesian statistical modeling and inference. While it provides a wide range of built-in distributions and functions, you may often encounter situations where you need to use custom functions in your Stan models. In this blog post, we will explore how to extend PyStan with custom functions.

## Why Extend PyStan?

Extending PyStan with custom functions can be useful in several scenarios:

1. **Incorporating domain-specific knowledge**: You may have domain-specific functions or formulas that are not available in PyStan. By extending PyStan, you can leverage these custom functions in your modeling and inference process.

2. **Efficient computation**: Some complex functions or calculations can be computationally expensive. By implementing them as custom functions in PyStan, you can optimize the computation and improve the efficiency of your models.

## Writing Custom Functions in Stan Language

Before extending PyStan with custom functions, you need to write the functions in Stan language. Stan is a probabilistic programming language with a syntax similar to C++. It allows you to define custom functions using the `functions` block.

Here's an example of writing a custom function in Stan:

```stan
functions {
  real myCustomFunction(real x, real y) {
    return x * y + exp(x);
  }
}
```

In this example, `myCustomFunction` takes two real inputs `x` and `y` and returns the result of `x*y + exp(x)`.

You can define any number of custom functions within the `functions` block.

## Incorporating Custom Functions in PyStan

To incorporate custom functions in PyStan, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Write the custom functions in Stan language**: As mentioned earlier, write your custom functions in Stan language and save them in a separate file with a `.stan` extension.

2. **Compile the Stan model**: Use the `pystan.StanModel` class to compile the Stan model, which includes the custom functions. This will generate a compiled model object that can be used for inference.

3. **Use the custom functions in your model**: Once the Stan model is compiled, you can use the custom functions in your model code. You can call them like any other built-in functions in PyStan.

Here's an example of using a custom function in PyStan:

```python
import pystan

# Compile the Stan model
model_code = """
functions {
  real myCustomFunction(real x, real y) {
    return x * y + exp(x);
  }
}
// Rest of your Stan model code
"""
model = pystan.StanModel(model_code=model_code)

# Use the custom function in your model
data = {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]}
result = model.sampling(data=data)
```

In this example, we compile the Stan model that includes the custom function `myCustomFunction`. We then use the custom function in the Stan model by passing the necessary data. Finally, we perform sampling using the compiled model.

## Conclusion

Extending PyStan with custom functions allows you to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and optimize the computation in your Bayesian models. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily write and use custom functions in PyStan. Happy modeling!
