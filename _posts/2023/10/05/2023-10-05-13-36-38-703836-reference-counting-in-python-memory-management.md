Python uses a mechanism called reference counting for memory management. Reference counting keeps track of the number of references to an object and when the reference count reaches zero, the object is automatically deleted from memory.

## How Reference Counting Works

1. When an object is created, the reference count is set to 1.
2. Whenever a new reference to the object is made, the reference count is incremented.
3. When a reference is removed, the reference count is decremented.
4. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is deleted.

```python
# Example code demonstrating reference counting
a = [1, 2, 3]  # reference count of the list object is 1
b = a  # reference count of the list object is incremented to 2
c = a  # reference count of the list object is incremented to 3
b = None  # reference count of the list object is decremented to 2
c = "hello"  # reference count of the list object is decremented to 1
a = None  # reference count of the list object is decremented to 0, and it is deleted
```

In the above example, the list object `[1, 2, 3]` is initially created with a reference count of 1. When `b` and `c` are assigned to `a`, the reference count of the list object is incremented to 3. When `b` is set to `None`, the reference count is decremented to 2, and when `c` is reassigned to a string, the reference count is further decremented to 1. Finally, when `a` is set to `None`, the reference count becomes 0 and the object is deleted.

## Advantages of Reference Counting

1. Simplicity: Reference counting is a simple memory management technique, with easy-to-understand rules.
2. Immediate reclamation: Objects are deleted as soon as their reference count reaches zero, immediately freeing up memory.
3. Deterministic behavior: The memory usage and deletion of objects can be easily predicted based on the reference count.

## Limitations of Reference Counting

1. Overhead: Maintaining reference counts for every object incurs some overhead, both in terms of memory usage and computational complexity.
2. Circular references: Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references, i.e., when two or more objects reference each other but have no external references. These objects may not be deleted even when their reference count reaches zero. Python uses additional mechanisms, such as cyclic garbage collection, to handle circular references.

Overall, reference counting in Python provides an efficient and deterministic way of managing memory. However, it is important to understand its limitations and consider other memory management techniques when dealing with more complex scenarios.
