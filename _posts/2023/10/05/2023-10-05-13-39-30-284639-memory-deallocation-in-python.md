When programming in Python, memory management is handled by the interpreter itself. Python uses a built-in garbage collector to automatically deallocate memory that is no longer used. However, understanding how memory deallocation works can be helpful in writing efficient and optimized Python code.

## Python's Garbage Collector

Python's garbage collector is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program. It keeps track of objects in memory and their references, and identifies objects that are no longer reachable from the program. 

The garbage collector performs memory deallocation in the background, periodically identifying and freeing up memory that can be reused. This process is known as garbage collection.

## Reference Counting

One of the simplest and most effective techniques used by Python's garbage collector is reference counting. Every object in Python has a reference count, which represents the number of references to that object.

When an object's reference count reaches zero, it means that the object is no longer reachable and can be deallocated. Python's garbage collector tracks these reference counts and deallocates the memory occupied by objects with zero reference counts.

## Circular References

Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references, where objects refer to each other in a way that forms a cycle. In such cases, objects may still have reference counts greater than zero, even though they are no longer reachable.

To handle circular references, Python's garbage collector uses a technique called *cycle detection*. It periodically identifies and collects cycles of objects, breaking the circular references and allowing the memory to be deallocated.

## Finalization and Explicit Memory Deallocation

In most cases, Python's automatic memory management is sufficient, and explicit memory deallocation is not required. However, in certain situations where external resources are being used, you may want to explicitly deallocate memory.

Python provides the `__del__` method, also known as the **finalizer**, which is called when an object is about to be deallocated. This method can be used to release any external resources associated with an object before its memory is freed.

It's important to note that relying solely on the `__del__` method for memory deallocation is not recommended. Python's garbage collector is efficient and reliable, and manual memory deallocation can introduce potential issues and bugs.

## Conclusion

Python's built-in garbage collector and memory management system take care of memory deallocation for you. Understanding the basics of how memory deallocation works in Python can help you write more optimized and efficient code. While explicit memory deallocation is rarely necessary, knowing when and how to use it can be beneficial in certain scenarios.
