## Introduction
Sockets allow applications to communicate over a network by sending and receiving data. In this case, we will focus on receiving files from a remote server using socket programming in Python.

## Setting Up the Server
To start receiving files, we first need to set up a server that listens for incoming connections. Here's an example code snippet to set up a simple server:

```python
import socket

host = "localhost"
port = 12345

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((host, port))
server_socket.listen(5)

client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connected to '{addr[0]}:{addr[1]}'")

```

In this code snippet, we have created a server socket, bound it to a specific host and port, and started listening for incoming connections. Once a client connects, we accept the connection and print the client's address.

## Receiving Files
To receive files over the socket, we need to add the following code after accepting the connection:

```python
file_name = "received_file.txt"

with open(file_name, "wb") as file:
    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        file.write(data)

print("File received successfully!")
```

In this code snippet, we specify a file name for the received file and open it in binary write mode. We then enter a loop, continuously receiving data from the client and writing it to the file. The loop breaks when no more data is received. Finally, we print a success message once the file has been received.

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can receive files over a socket connection using Python. Understanding the basics of socket programming enables you to build powerful network applications that exchange data efficiently.
