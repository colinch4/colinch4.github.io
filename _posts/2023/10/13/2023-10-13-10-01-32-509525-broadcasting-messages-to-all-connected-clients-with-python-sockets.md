In network programming, being able to broadcast messages to multiple clients connected to a server is a common requirement. Python provides the `socket` module, which allows you to create network sockets and establish communication between different hosts.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Python sockets to implement a simple server that can broadcast messages to all connected clients.

## Setting up the Server

First, we need to import the `socket` module and create a TCP socket for our server:

```python
import socket

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = 9999

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
server_socket.listen(5)

print(f"Server listening on {HOST}:{PORT}")
```

Here, we specify the `HOST` as `'localhost'` to bind the socket to the local machine, and we choose the `PORT` as `9999`. The `listen(5)` function sets the server to listen for at most 5 incoming connections.

## Accepting Client Connections

Next, we need to accept client connections and create separate threads to handle each client. This allows multiple clients to connect to our server simultaneously:

```python
import threading

connected_clients = []

def handle_client(client_socket, client_address):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
            if message:
                print(f"Message received from {client_address}: {message}")
                broadcast(message)
        except ConnectionResetError:
            connected_clients.remove(client_socket)
            print(f"Client {client_address} disconnected.")
            break

while True:
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    connected_clients.append(client_socket)
    print(f"Client {client_address} connected.")
    threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket, client_address)).start()
```

In this code, we define the `handle_client` function that receives messages from a client and broadcasts them to all other connected clients. We use a `while` loop to continuously receive messages from a client until the connection is closed or an error occurs.

We then use `server_socket.accept()` to accept incoming client connections. Once a client is connected, we add its socket to the `connected_clients` list and create a new thread to handle that client.

## Broadcasting Messages

To broadcast a message to all connected clients, we iterate over the `connected_clients` list and send the message using each client socket:

```python
def broadcast(message):
    for client_socket in connected_clients:
        try:
            client_socket.sendall(message.encode())
        except OSError:
            connected_clients.remove(client_socket)
```

The `broadcast` function takes a message as input and sends it to each connected client using the `sendall` method of the client socket. If an error occurs while sending the message, we remove the client socket from the `connected_clients` list.

## Handling Client Disconnections

To properly handle client disconnections, we catch the `ConnectionResetError` exception in the `handle_client` function. If a client socket is disconnected, we remove it from the `connected_clients` list and inform the server console:

```python
except ConnectionResetError:
    connected_clients.remove(client_socket)
    print(f"Client {client_address} disconnected.")
    break
```

## Running the Server

To run the server, save the above code in a Python file and execute it. You should see the server listening on the specified address and port.

Clients can now connect to the server by establishing a TCP connection to the server's address and port. Once connected, the server will be able to broadcast messages to all connected clients.

```bash
python server.py
```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use Python sockets to implement a server that can broadcast messages to all connected clients. You can now utilize this knowledge to build more advanced network applications or add more functionality to the server, such as handling multiple types of messages or implementing encryption.

For further information and more advanced use of sockets in Python, refer to the official Python documentation and socket programming tutorials.

Keep in mind that the above code is a simplified example to demonstrate the concept and may not include error handling and edge cases.
