In Python, metaclasses allow us to define the behavior of classes. We can leverage metaclasses to implement dynamic data validation and sanitation in our applications. This powerful feature allows us to define rules for how data should be validated and sanitized before it is assigned to class attributes.

### What are Metaclasses?

Metaclasses are the "classes of classes" or "blueprints of classes." They define the structure and behavior of classes. When we create a class, it is actually an instance of its metaclass. In Python, all classes are derived from the `type` metaclass by default.

### The `__init__` Method and Data Validation

The `__init__` method is called when an instance of a class is created. We can override this method in a metaclass to add data validation logic. Let's see an example:

```python
class DataValidator(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
            if isinstance(attr_value, str):
                attrs[attr_name] = attr_value.strip()  # Sanitize string attributes
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class UserData(metaclass=DataValidator):
    name = '  John Doe  '
    email = ' john@example.com '

user = UserData()
print(user.name)  # Output: 'John Doe'
print(user.email)  # Output: 'john@example.com'
```

In the above example, we define a metaclass `DataValidator` that overrides the `__new__` method. This method is called before creating a new class. It iterates over the attributes of the class and applies data sanitation to string attributes by stripping leading and trailing whitespaces.

When creating an instance of `UserData`, the metaclass `DataValidator` is invoked automatically. The `name` and `email` attributes are sanitized before being assigned to the class instance.

### Custom Validation Rules

We can extend the `DataValidator` metaclass to include custom validation rules. We can define rules for attributes based on their data types or any other criteria we need. Let's extend our previous example:

```python
class DataValidator(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
            if isinstance(attr_value, str):
                attrs[attr_name] = attr_value.strip()  # Sanitize string attributes

        if 'email' in attrs:
            email = attrs['email']
            if not email.endswith('@example.com'):
                raise ValueError("Invalid email format")

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class UserData(metaclass=DataValidator):
    name = '  John Doe  '
    email = ' john@example.org '  # This will raise a ValueError

user = UserData()
```

In this updated example, we add a custom validation rule to the `DataValidator` metaclass. It checks if the `email` attribute ends with `@example.com`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. This way, we can ensure that our data meets specific requirements during class instantiation.

### Conclusion

Metaclasses in Python provide a powerful tool for implementing dynamic data validation and sanitation. By using metaclasses, we can define rules that automatically sanitize and validate data before assigning it to class attributes. This enables us to ensure the integrity and correctness of our data within our applications.
