In software development, dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC) are design patterns that help to decouple components, improve testability, and make code more modular. While there are several ways to implement DI and IoC in Python, one powerful approach utilizes metaclasses.

Metaclasses are the "classes of classes" in Python. By using metaclasses, we can modify the behavior of class creation, allowing us to inject dependencies at the class level. This technique is particularly useful for implementing IoC containers and managing object creation and wiring.

Let's dive into an example to understand how we can use metaclasses for DI and IoC in Python:

## Example: Metaclass-based DI/IoC

```python
class DependencyInjector(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        dependencies = {}
        for key, value in attrs.items():
            if hasattr(value, '__dependencies__'):
                dependencies[key] = value.__dependencies__
        
        attrs['__dependencies__'] = dependencies
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)


class ServiceA:
    def __init__(self, service_b):
        self.service_b = service_b


class ServiceB:
    def __init__(self):
        pass


class MyApp(metaclass=DependencyInjector):
    service_a = ServiceA
    service_b = ServiceB
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}
        
        for key, deps in self.__dependencies__.items():
            dependencies = []
            for dep in deps:
                dependencies.append(self.services[dep])
            
            self.services[key] = self.__dependencies__[key](*dependencies)


app = MyApp()
print(app.services['service_a'].service_b)
```

In this example, we define a metaclass `DependencyInjector` that scans the attributes of a class and collects any attributes that have a `__dependencies__` variable attributed to them. The `__dependencies__` variable stores a list of required dependencies for that attribute.

We then define two services, `ServiceA` and `ServiceB`, where `ServiceA` depends on an instance of `ServiceB`.

Finally, we define the main application class `MyApp` and specify it to use the `DependencyInjector` metaclass. We provide the required services (`ServiceA` and `ServiceB`) as attributes of `MyApp`. The metaclass ensures that the dependencies are injected during the class instantiation process.

Running the code will output an instance of `ServiceB` inside `ServiceA`, demonstrating that the dependency injection was successful.

## Conclusion

Metaclasses provide a powerful way to achieve dependency injection and inversion of control in Python. By using metaclasses, we can modify the behavior of class creation and inject dependencies at the class level, making our code more modular, testable, and decoupled.

Remember, metaclasses are a powerful tool, and it's important to use them judiciously and when they provide clear benefits in terms of code structure and maintainability.
