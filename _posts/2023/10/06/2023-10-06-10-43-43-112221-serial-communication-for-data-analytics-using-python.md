## Introduction

In the field of data analytics, it is often necessary to collect data from external devices or sensors in real-time. Serial communication is a common method used to achieve this. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform serial communication using Python for data analytics purposes.

## What is Serial Communication?

Serial communication is a method of transmitting data between a computer and an external device using a serial port or a USB connection. It involves sending data one bit at a time over a communication channel.

## Python Serial Library

Python provides a powerful library called `pyserial` that allows us to easily communicate with external devices using serial communication. To install this library, run the following command:

```
pip install pyserial
```

## Establishing Serial Connection

To establish a serial connection with an external device, we need to know the port to which the device is connected and the baud rate at which the communication should happen. The baud rate specifies the speed at which the data is transmitted.

```python
import serial

# Specify the port and baud rate
port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
baud_rate = 9600

# Create a serial connection
ser = serial.Serial(port, baud_rate)
```

## Reading Serial Data

Once the connection is established, we can start reading data from the external device. We can use the `readline()` method to read a line of data from the serial connection.

```python
while True:
    # Read a line of data
    data = ser.readline().decode().strip()
    
    # Perform data analytics operations on the received data
    # ...
```

## Writing Serial Data

In some cases, we may also need to send data to the external device. We can use the `write()` method to send data over the serial connection.

```python
# Send data to the external device
ser.write(b'This is a sample message')
```

## Closing the Serial Connection

Once we are done with communicating with the external device, it is important to close the serial connection to free up system resources.

```python
# Close the serial connection
ser.close()
```

## Conclusion

Serial communication is an essential technique in the field of data analytics for collecting data from external devices. In this blog post, we explored how to perform serial communication using Python, specifically using the `pyserial` library. By establishing a serial connection, reading and writing data, and closing the connection, we can easily integrate external devices into our data analytics workflows.
