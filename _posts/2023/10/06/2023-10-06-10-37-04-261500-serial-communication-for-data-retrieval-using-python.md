Serial communication is a common method used to exchange data between a computer and an external device. In this blog post, we will explore how to retrieve data from an external device using serial communication in Python.

## Introduction to Serial Communication

Serial communication involves the transmission of data in a bit-by-bit fashion over a physical connection. It is commonly used for communicating with microcontrollers, sensors, and other devices that do not have a direct network connection.

Python provides a built-in module called `serial` that allows us to establish communication with external devices using the serial port. We can use this module to both send and receive data over the serial connection.

## Setting up Serial Communication in Python

To begin with, we need to install the `pyserial` library, which provides the necessary tools for serial communication in Python. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pyserial
```

Once installed, we can import the `serial` module in our Python script and create a serial object:

```python
import serial

# Create a serial object
ser = serial.Serial('COM1', 9600)
```

In the above example, we created a serial object named `ser` that will communicate with the device connected to COM1 serial port at a baud rate of 9600.

## Reading Data from the Serial Port

Once the serial connection is established, we can read data from the serial port using the `read()` or `readline()` method of the serial object. The `read()` method reads a specified number of bytes from the serial port, while the `readline()` method reads a line of data terminated by a newline character.

```python
# Read a line from the serial port
line = ser.readline()
```

The above example reads a line of data from the serial port and stores it in the `line` variable.

## Parsing and Processing the Retrieved Data

The data retrieved from the serial port is usually in binary form. Depending on the requirements, we may need to parse and process the data before using it further. For example, we might need to extract specific values or convert the data into a different format.

```python
# Convert the retrieved data from binary to string
line = line.decode('utf-8')

# Perform further processing on the data
# ...
```

In the above example, we decode the retrieved data from binary to a string format using the `decode()` method.

## Conclusion

Serial communication is an effective way to exchange data between a computer and external devices. With the help of the `serial` module in Python, we can easily establish a serial connection and retrieve data from the connected device.

In this blog post, we covered the basics of setting up serial communication in Python and reading data from the serial port. We also touched upon parsing and processing the retrieved data. With this knowledge, you can now start building applications that involve serial communication and data retrieval.
