## Introduction
GPS (Global Positioning System) devices are widely used to obtain the geographical coordinates of a location. These devices communicate with a computer or microcontroller using the serial communication protocol.

In this blog post, we will learn how to establish serial communication with GPS devices using Python. We will use the `pyserial` library in Python to interact with the GPS device.

## Setting up the Environment
Before we start, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python.

Next, we need to install the `pyserial` library. Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```python
pip install pyserial
```

## Connecting to the GPS Device
To connect to the GPS device, we need to determine the serial port on which it is connected. You can find the port name by checking the device manager or using the following code:

```python
import serial.tools.list_ports

ports = serial.tools.list_ports.comports()
for port, desc, hwid in sorted(ports):
    print(f"Port: {port}")
```

This code will list all available ports on your computer. Identify the port to which your GPS device is connected and make note of the port name.

## Reading GPS Data
To read data from the GPS device, we will use the `serial` module from the `pyserial` library. Here's an example code that reads and prints the data from the GPS device:

```python
import serial

# Specify the port name of your GPS device
port = 'COM4'  # Replace with the actual port name

# Create a serial connection
ser = serial.Serial(port, baudrate=9600, timeout=1)

while True:
    line = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if line.startswith('$GPRMC'):
        print(line)
```

In the code above, replace `'COM4'` with the actual port name of your GPS device. The code establishes a serial connection with the specified port and reads data from it. It filters the received data and prints only the lines starting with `$GPRMC`, which are standard NMEA sentences containing location information.

## Parsing GPS Data
To extract useful information from the GPS data, we need to parse the NMEA sentences. The `pynmea2` library in Python provides a simple way to parse NMEA sentences and extract relevant information.

Install the `pynmea2` library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```python
pip install pynmea2
```

Here's an updated code snippet that parses the GPS data and extracts latitude and longitude information:

```python
import serial
import pynmea2

# Specify the port name of your GPS device
port = 'COM4'  # Replace with the actual port name

# Create a serial connection
ser = serial.Serial(port, baudrate=9600, timeout=1)

while True:
    line = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if line.startswith('$GPRMC'):
        data = pynmea2.parse(line)
        if data.latitude and data.longitude:
            print(f"Latitude: {data.latitude}")
            print(f"Longitude: {data.longitude}")
```

Make sure to import the `pynmea2` library and call the `pynmea2.parse()` method to parse the received NMEA sentence. We check if latitude and longitude values are available before printing them.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to establish serial communication with GPS devices using Python. We used the `pyserial` library to connect to the GPS device and read the NMEA sentences. With the help of the `pynmea2` library, we parsed the GPS data and extracted latitude and longitude information.
