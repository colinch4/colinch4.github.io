Decision trees are popular machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and captures noise in the training data. Pruning methods are employed to reduce the complexity of decision trees and improve their generalization capacity.

## Pre-Pruning

Pre-pruning is a pruning method that stops the construction of a decision tree early, before it becomes fully grown. It involves setting specific conditions to terminate the tree-building process based on certain pre-defined criteria. This helps prevent overfitting by limiting the depth and breadth of the decision tree.

Some common pre-pruning techniques include:

### Maximum Depth

With maximum depth pruning, a decision tree is restricted to a certain depth or number of levels. The tree-building process stops once this depth is reached. This prevents the tree from growing too deep and capturing noise in the data.

```python
# Example code for maximum depth pre-pruning
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
```

### Minimum Samples Split

Minimum samples split pruning sets a threshold for the minimum number of samples required in order to create a split at a node. If the number of samples at a node is below this threshold, no further splitting will occur, effectively pruning the tree.

```python
# Example code for minimum samples split pre-pruning
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split=10)
```

## Post-Pruning

Post-pruning, also known as backward pruning, is a pruning method that involves growing a decision tree to its entirety and then removing or collapsing certain nodes according to pruning criteria. This approach is more computationally intensive compared to pre-pruning, but it can lead to improved accuracy by retaining potentially valuable branches of the original tree.

The most commonly used method for post-pruning is:

### Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP)

Cost Complexity Pruning, often referred to as alpha pruning or weakest link pruning, is a post-pruning method that assigns a cost parameter, alpha, to each node in the decision tree. The alpha parameter represents the amount of improvement in the model's complexity required to justify removing a node. By iteratively evaluating different alpha values, the node(s) with the lowest alpha values are pruned.

```python
# Example code for cost complexity pruning
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=0.01)
```

# Conclusion

Pre-pruning and post-pruning are two common methods used to reduce overfitting in decision trees. Pre-pruning stops the tree construction process early, while post-pruning involves removing or collapsing nodes after the tree is fully grown. Both techniques help improve the generalization capability of decision trees, leading to more accurate predictions.
