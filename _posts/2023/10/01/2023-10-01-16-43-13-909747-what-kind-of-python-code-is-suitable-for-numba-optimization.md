There are a few types of Python code that are particularly suitable for Numba optimization. Let's explore some examples:

1. Numeric computations: Numba excels at accelerating numerical computations, such as matrix operations, linear algebra, and scientific simulations. You can achieve significant speedups by decorating your pure Python functions with `@jit` or `@njit` decorators.

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import njit

@njit
def calculate_squares(n):
    squares = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(n):
        squares[i] = i**2
    return squares

result = calculate_squares(1000000)
print(result)
```

2. Loops: Numba can also optimize loops in your code, making them run faster. By using `@jit` or `@njit` decorators, you can instruct Numba to compile the loop to machine code. This is particularly useful when dealing with nested loops or functions that are executed repeatedly.

```python
from numba import jit

@jit
def sum_matrix(matrix):
    rows, cols = matrix.shape
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            total_sum += matrix[i, j]
    return total_sum

matrix = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
result = sum_matrix(matrix)
print(result)
```

3. Computations on large data structures: If you are performing calculations on large data structures like arrays or dataframes, Numba's ability to compile the code to machine code can lead to significant performance improvements.

```python
from numba import jit

@jit
def compute_mean(data):
    total_sum = 0
    count = 0
    for value in data:
        total_sum += value
        count += 1
    return total_sum / count

data = np.random.rand(1000000)
result = compute_mean(data)
print(result)
```

Remember, Numba is best suited for code that involves numeric computations, loops, and large data structures. However, it may not provide substantial improvements for all types of Python code. It's always a good idea to profile and benchmark your code to determine if Numba optimization is worth the effort.
