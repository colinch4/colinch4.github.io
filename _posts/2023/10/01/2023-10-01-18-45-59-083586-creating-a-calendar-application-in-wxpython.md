In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple calendar application using the WXPython library. WXPython is a Python wrapper for the wxWidgets library, which provides a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools for building cross-platform applications.

## Installing WXPython

Before we get started, we need to make sure that WXPython is installed on our system. To install WXPython, we can use `pip` by running the following command:

```
pip install wxPython
```

If you are using a different package manager, refer to its documentation for installation instructions.

## Creating a Calendar Window

Let's start by creating a basic WXPython application and a window to display our calendar. Here's the code:

```python
import wx

class CalendarFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super().__init__(parent, title=title, size=(400, 400))
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        
        self.cal_ctrl = wx.CalendarCtrl(self.panel, id=wx.ID_ANY)
        self.cal_ctrl.Bind(wx.EVT_CALENDAR_SEL_CHANGED, self.on_date_selected)
        
        self.sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        self.sizer.Add(self.cal_ctrl, 0, wx.ALL, 10)
        
        self.panel.SetSizerAndFit(self.sizer)
        self.Show()

    def on_date_selected(self, event):
        date = self.cal_ctrl.GetDate()
        print("Selected Date:", date)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = wx.App()
    frame = CalendarFrame(None, "My Calendar")
    app.MainLoop()
```

## Understanding the Code

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. We import the necessary `wx` module to access the WXPython library.
2. We define a class `CalendarFrame` that inherits from `wx.Frame`. This class represents the main window of our calendar application.
3. In the `__init__` method of `CalendarFrame`, we create a panel and a calendar control using the `wx.CalendarCtrl` class. We also bind the `EVT_CALENDAR_SEL_CHANGED` event to a method `on_date_selected` that will be called when a date is selected in the calendar.
4. We create a sizer (layout manager) and add the calendar control to it with some padding.
5. We set the sizer as the main sizer for the panel and call `SetSizerAndFit` to automatically resize the window based on its contents.
6. Finally, we show the main window by calling `Show()`.
7. In the `on_date_selected` method, we retrieve the selected date from the `cal_ctrl` calendar control and print it to the console.

## Running the Application

To run the application, save the code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `calendar_app.py`). Then, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is located, and execute the following command:

```
python calendar_app.py
```

You should see a window with a calendar control. Try selecting different dates, and you should see the selected date printed in the console.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple calendar application using WXPython. We created a window with a calendar control and displayed the selected date. You can further enhance this application by adding additional features, such as event notifications or allowing users to add events to specific dates. Get creative and explore the different capabilities of WXPython to build more advanced calendar applications.
