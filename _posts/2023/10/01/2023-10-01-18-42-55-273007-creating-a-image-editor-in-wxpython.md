## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple image editor using the WXPython library. WXPython is a powerful toolkit for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. We will be using it to create a basic image editing application that allows users to open, edit, and save images.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have Python and the WXPython library installed on your system. You can install WXPython using the following command:

```python
pip install wxpython
```

## Setting up the GUI

To start, let's create a new Python file called `image_editor.py`. We will first import the necessary libraries and create a new class that will serve as our main window:

```python
import wx

class ImageEditor(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(ImageEditor, self).__init__(parent, title=title)
        
        self.initialize()

    def initialize(self):
        # Add GUI elements here
        
        # Set up event handlers
        
        # Show the main window
        self.Show()
```

Inside the `initialize` method, we will add the GUI elements, set up event handlers, and show the main window. Let's start by adding a menu bar and a file menu to it:

```python
def initialize(self):
    menubar = wx.MenuBar()
    file_menu = wx.Menu()

    menubar.Append(file_menu, '&File')
    self.SetMenuBar(menubar)
```

Next, let's add a few menu items to the file menu, such as open, save, and exit:

```python
file_menu.Append(wx.ID_OPEN, '&Open', 'Open an image')
file_menu.Append(wx.ID_SAVE, '&Save', 'Save the image')
file_menu.AppendSeparator()
file_menu.Append(wx.ID_EXIT, 'E&xit', 'Exit the application')
```

We also need to bind these menu items to their respective event handlers. Let's create empty event handlers for now:

```python
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_open, id=wx.ID_OPEN)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_save, id=wx.ID_SAVE)
self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_exit, id=wx.ID_EXIT)
```

## Adding Functionality

Now that we have the basic structure of our image editor, let's add the functionality to open, edit, and save images. We will make use of the `wx.Image` class to load and manipulate images.

### Opening and Displaying an Image

In the `on_open` event handler, we will prompt the user to select an image file and display it in the main window:

```python
def on_open(self, event):
    dlg = wx.FileDialog(self, 'Open Image', wildcard='Image files (*.jpg; *.png)|*.jpg;*.png',
                        style=wx.FD_OPEN | wx.FD_FILE_MUST_EXIST)

    if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
        filepath = dlg.GetPath()
        
        # Load the image using wx.Image
        image = wx.Image(filepath, wx.BITMAP_TYPE_ANY)
        
        # Create a bitmap from the image
        bitmap = wx.Bitmap(image)
        
        # Create a panel to display the bitmap
        panel = wx.Panel(self)
        wx.StaticBitmap(panel, -1, bitmap)
        
        self.Layout()  # Refresh the layout
        
    dlg.Destroy()
```

In this code, we create a file dialog to prompt the user to select an image file. If the user chooses a file, we load the image using `wx.Image` and create a bitmap from it. We then create a panel and add a static bitmap control to display the image.

### Saving the Image

In the `on_save` event handler, we will prompt the user to select a file path and save the image:

```python
def on_save(self, event):
    dlg = wx.FileDialog(self, 'Save Image', wildcard='Image files (*.jpg; *.png)|*.jpg;*.png',
                        style=wx.FD_SAVE | wx.FD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT)

    if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
        filepath = dlg.GetPath()
        
        # Get the bitmap from the static bitmap control
        bitmap = self.isPanel().GetChildren()[0].GetBitmap()
        
        # Save the bitmap as an image file
        bitmap.SaveFile(filepath, wx.BITMAP_TYPE_ANY)
        
    dlg.Destroy()
```

This code creates a file dialog to prompt the user to select a file path for saving the image. If the user chooses a file, we retrieve the bitmap from the static bitmap control and save it as an image file using the `SaveFile` method.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple image editor using WXPython. We covered the basics of creating a GUI, adding menu items, and implementing functionality to open, edit, and save images. You can now expand upon this basic editor and add more features such as image manipulation tools, filters, and more.
