If you want to display HTML content within your WXPython application, there are a few options available to you. While there is no built-in HTML widget in WXPython, you can use the WebView or the HTMLWindow classes to achieve this.

Here is an example of how you can display HTML content using the WebView class in WXPython:

```python
import wx
import wx.html2 as html2

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(parent=None, title="HTML WebView Example")

        self.webview = html2.WebView.New(self)
        self.webview.LoadURL("https://www.example.com")

        sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        sizer.Add(self.webview, 1, wx.EXPAND)
        self.SetSizer(sizer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = wx.App()
    frame = MyFrame()
    frame.Show()
    app.MainLoop()
```

In the above code, we first import the necessary modules from the WXPython library. We then define a class `MyFrame` that inherits from `wx.Frame`.

Within the `MyFrame` class, we create an instance of `html2.WebView`, which provides us with the ability to render HTML content. We load a URL using the `LoadURL` method, but you can also display local HTML files by passing their file URI.

Finally, we create a sizer and add the web view to it. We set the sizer as the sizer for our frame using `SetSizer`.

Running this code will open a WXPython window that displays the HTML content at the specified URL inside the WebView widget.

Remember to have the `wx.html2` module installed to use the WebView class. In most cases, you can install it using the command `pip install wxPython`.
