In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple window using the WXPython library. WXPython is a Python wrapper for the wxWidgets C++ library, which allows us to create native-looking graphical user interfaces (GUI) across different platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- pip package installer
- WXPython library (installed using pip)

## Step 1: Importing the necessary library

First, we need to import the `wx` module to access the WXPython library.

```python
import wx
```

## Step 2: Creating the application object

Next, we will create an instance of the `wx.App` class. This object represents our application and is required to initialize the WXPython framework.

```python
app = wx.App()
```

## Step 3: Creating a frame

A frame is a top-level window that serves as the main container for our GUI. We can create a frame object by instantiating the `wx.Frame` class. We can customize the frame's title, size, and position.

```python
frame = wx.Frame(None, title="Simple Window", size=(400, 300))
```

## Step 4: Showing the frame

To make the frame visible, we need to call the `Show()` method.

```python
frame.Show()
```

## Step 5: Running the application

Finally, we need to run the application by calling the `MainLoop()` method. This method starts the event loop, allowing user interactions and handling events.

```python
app.MainLoop()
```

## Full example code

```python
import wx

app = wx.App()

frame = wx.Frame(None, title="Simple Window", size=(400, 300))
frame.Show()

app.MainLoop()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a simple window using the WXPython library. By following these steps, you can start building more complex GUI applications with WXPython. Make sure to explore the official [WXPython documentation](https://wxpython.org/) to discover more features and functionalities.
