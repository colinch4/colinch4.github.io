In this tutorial, we will explore how to create an RSS feed reader using the WXPython library. WXPython is a powerful GUI toolkit for the Python programming language that allows us to create desktop applications with a native look and feel.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

1. Python installed on your machine (version 3 or above)
2. WXPython library installed (`pip install wxpython`)

## Setting up the Project

Let's start by creating a new Python file, `rss_reader.py`, and importing the necessary modules:

```python
import wx
import feedparser
```

We'll be using the `wx.App` class to create our application. Next, let's define our main application window:

```python
class RSSReader(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(None, title="RSS Reader")
        
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        self.sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        
        self.feed_url = wx.TextCtrl(self.panel)
        self.btn_fetch = wx.Button(self.panel, label="Fetch RSS")
        
        self.sizer.Add(self.feed_url, 0, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 10)
        self.sizer.Add(self.btn_fetch, 0, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 10)
        
        self.panel.SetSizer(self.sizer)
```

In the code above, we create a new frame using `wx.Frame` and add a panel and a sizer to it. We also create a `wx.TextCtrl` widget to input the RSS feed URL and a `wx.Button` widget to fetch the RSS feed.

Next, let's define the event handlers for the widgets:

```python
class RSSReader(wx.Frame):
    # ...

    def on_fetch(self, event):
        url = self.feed_url.GetValue()
        feed = feedparser.parse(url)
        
        for entry in feed.entries:
            print(f"Title: {entry.title}")
            print(f"Link: {entry.link}")
            print(f"Published: {entry.published}")
            print(f"\n---\n")
    
    def bind_events(self):
        self.btn_fetch.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_fetch)
```

The `on_fetch` method retrieves the value from the `TextCtrl` widget, parses the RSS feed using `feedparser`, and prints the title, link, and published date of each entry.

We also bind the `on_fetch` method to the button's click event using the `Bind` method in the `bind_events` method.

Finally, let's create an instance of our `RSSReader` class and run the application:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = wx.App()
    frame = RSSReader()
    frame.bind_events()
    frame.Show()
    app.MainLoop()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a basic RSS feed reader using the WXPython library. WXPython provides a robust set of tools for creating desktop applications, allowing us to take advantage of the native capabilities of the operating system. With this foundation, you can extend the functionality of the RSS reader by adding features such as displaying the feed contents in a tree-like structure or implementing search capabilities.
