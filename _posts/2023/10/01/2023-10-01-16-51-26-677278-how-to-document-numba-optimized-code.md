When working with Numba, a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler for Python, it is important to document your code effectively. Documenting Numba-optimized code not only helps others understand your codebase but also makes it easier for you to maintain and debug your code in the future. In this blog post, we'll explore some best practices for documenting Numba-optimized code.

## 1. Use Docstrings

**Docstrings** provide a standardized way of adding documentation to your Python functions, classes, and modules. You can include information about the purpose of the code, its usage, input/output expectations, and any notable caveats.

```python
import numba as nb

@nb.njit
def add(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers together.
    
    Parameters:
    - a (int): The first number.
    - b (int): The second number.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b
```

Using docstrings in your Numba-optimized functions makes it easier for others (including your future self) to understand how to use them correctly. It also helps tools like IDEs and documentation generators to extract and present this information effectively.

## 2. Include Numba Version Requirements

Numba evolves over time, introducing new features and optimizations. It's important to **include version requirements** in your documentation if you rely on specific Numba features or syntax.

For example, if you use Numba's `njit` decorator with the `parallel=True` option, you can specify the minimum Numba version required:

```python
import numba as nb

@nb.njit(parallel=True, enable='auto')
def parallel_sum(arr):
    """
    Sums up an array in parallel using Numba.
    
    Parameters:
    - arr (numpy.ndarray): Input array to be summed.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The sum of all elements in the input array.
    """
    return nb.np.sum(arr)
```

Including version requirements ensures that users of your code are aware of any dependencies or limitations.

## 3. Explain Performance Trade-offs

Numba offers significant performance improvements, but it might require different coding techniques compared to regular Python code. Documenting any **performance trade-offs** and caveats can help users understand the limitations and guide them in making informed decisions.

For example, if you use Numba to optimize a function for speed, but at the cost of increased memory usage, make sure to mention this in your documentation:

```python
import numba as nb

@nb.njit
def optimized_function():
    """
    An optimized function with improved speed, but increased memory usage.
    
    Returns:
    - result (numpy.ndarray): The result of the optimization.
    """
    # Code implementation goes here...
```

## 4. Provide Usage Examples

Adding **usage examples** in your documentation can greatly enhance its value. You can demonstrate common use cases, edge cases, and expected input/output examples. These examples can serve as a starting point for users to understand how to incorporate your Numba-optimized code into their own projects.

```python
import numba as nb

@nb.njit
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using Numba.
    
    Parameters:
    - n (int): The index of the Fibonacci number to calculate.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Fibonacci number.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Usage example:
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

Including well-commented usage examples helps users quickly understand how to use your code effectively.

## #Numba #Documentation

By following these best practices, you can effectively document your Numba-optimized code and make it more accessible to others. Good documentation not only helps users but also improves the maintainability and longevity of your codebase. So, start incorporating these practices in your code and unlock the full potential of Numba for optimized performance.
