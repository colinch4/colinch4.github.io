Are you looking to create a simple photo viewer application? Look no further! In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a photo viewer using WXPython, a popular GUI toolkit for Python.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have WXPython installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it using pip:

```python
pip install wxpython
```

### Creating the Photo Viewer
First, let's import the necessary modules:

```python
import wx
```

Next, we will create a `PhotoViewer` class that inherits from `wx.Frame`. This will serve as the main window of our application:

```python
class PhotoViewer(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(PhotoViewer, self).__init__(parent, title=title)
        self.InitUI()

    def InitUI(self):
        # Photo viewer UI initialization code goes here
        pass
```

Inside the `__init__` method, we call the `InitUI` method to initialize the user interface.

Now, let's add the code to create the main window and display an image:

```python
class PhotoViewer(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(PhotoViewer, self).__init__(parent, title=title)
        self.InitUI()

    def InitUI(self):
        self.SetSize((800, 600))

        hbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.HORIZONTAL)

        panel = wx.Panel(self)
        vbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)

        img = wx.Image("path/to/your/image.jpg", wx.BITMAP_TYPE_ANY)
        image_ctrl = wx.StaticBitmap(panel, wx.ID_ANY, wx.BitmapFromImage(img))
        vbox.Add(image_ctrl, proportion=1, flag=wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, border=10)

        panel.SetSizer(vbox)
        hbox.Add(panel, proportion=1, flag=wx.EXPAND)

        self.SetSizer(hbox)
        self.Layout()
```

In the above code, we set the size of the main window to 800x600 pixels. We create a `wx.BoxSizer` called `hbox` to hold the main panel, and another `wx.BoxSizer` called `vbox` to hold the image control. We load an image from a specified path and create a `wx.StaticBitmap` control to display the image. Finally, we add the image control to the vertical sizer, set the sizer for the panel, and add the panel to the horizontal sizer.

### Running the Photo Viewer Application
To run the photo viewer application, we need to create an instance of the `PhotoViewer` class and call the `Show` method:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = wx.App()
    frame = PhotoViewer(None, "Photo Viewer")
    frame.Show()
    app.MainLoop()
```

Save the above code in a Python file and run it. You should see a window with your specified image displayed!

### Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple photo viewer application using WXPython. You can further enhance the application by adding features like image navigation or the ability to open multiple images. Have fun exploring the capabilities of WXPython and enjoy building your own applications!
