Data grids are commonly used in many applications to display and manipulate tabular data. In WXPython, the wx.grid module provides a flexible and powerful way to create and manage data grids. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with data grids in WXPython and introduce some useful features and techniques.

## Creating a Basic Data Grid

To create a basic data grid, we need to first import the necessary modules:

```python
import wx
import wx.grid
```

Next, we create a wx.grid.Grid object and set the number of rows and columns:

```python
app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(None, title="Data Grid Example")
grid = wx.grid.Grid(frame)
grid.CreateGrid(5, 3)
```

After creating the grid, we can populate it with data using the `SetCellValue` method:

```python
grid.SetCellValue(0, 0, "Name")
grid.SetCellValue(0, 1, "Age")
grid.SetCellValue(0, 2, "City")

grid.SetCellValue(1, 0, "John Doe")
grid.SetCellValue(1, 1, "30")
grid.SetCellValue(1, 2, "New York")
```

Finally, we need to show the frame and start the application's event loop:

```python
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()
```

## Handling Events

Data grids support various events that can be handled to perform actions based on user interactions. Here's an example of handling the selection change event:

```python
def on_selection_changed(event):
    row = event.GetRow()
    col = event.GetCol()
    value = grid.GetCellValue(row, col)
    print(f"Selected cell: {row}, {col} - Value: {value}")

grid.Bind(wx.grid.EVT_GRID_CELL_LEFT_CLICK, on_selection_changed)
```

In the above code, we define a `on_selection_changed` function that is called when a cell is left-clicked. The function retrieves the selected cell's row, column, and value using the `GetRow`, `GetCol`, and `GetCellValue` methods.

## Customizing the Appearance

WXPython provides several options to customize the appearance of data grids. We can change the cell background color, font, alignment, and more. Here's an example:

```python
attr = wx.grid.GridCellAttr()
attr.SetBackgroundColour(wx.Colour(255, 0, 0))  # Set cell background color to red
attr.SetFont(wx.Font(12, wx.FONTFAMILY_DEFAULT, wx.FONTSTYLE_NORMAL, wx.FONTWEIGHT_BOLD))
attr.SetAlignment(wx.ALIGN_CENTER)  # Center align the cell content

grid.SetAttr(1, 1, attr)  # Apply the custom attributes to a specific cell
```

In the above code, we create a `GridCellAttr` object and set its properties, such as background color, font, and alignment. We then apply these attributes to a specific cell using the `SetAttr` method.

## Conclusion

Working with data grids in WXPython is straightforward and provides a flexible way to display and manipulate tabular data. We can create basic grids, handle events, and customize the appearance to suit our application's needs. Make sure to explore the WXPython documentation for more advanced features and techniques.
