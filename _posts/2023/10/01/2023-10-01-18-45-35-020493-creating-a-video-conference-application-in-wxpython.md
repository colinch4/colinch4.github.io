In today's blog post, we will learn how to create a video conference application using **WXPython**, a Python wrapper for the **wxWidgets** GUI library. With the increasing demand for remote communication, video conferencing has become an essential part of our lives. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of how to build a video conference application using WXPython.

# Prerequisites
Before we start building our application, make sure you have the following:

1. Python installed on your machine
2. WXPython library installed (`pip install wxpython`)
3. Basic knowledge of Python programming language

# Setting up the Environment
Once you have Python and WXPython installed, create a new Python script, `video_conference.py`, and import the necessary libraries:

```python
import wx
import wx.media
```

# Designing the User Interface

Now, let's create the user interface for our video conference application. We will use the `wx.media.MediaCtrl` class to display the video feed. 

Below is an example of a simple user interface layout using WXPython:

```python
class VideoConferenceFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(VideoConferenceFrame, self).__init__(parent, title=title, size=(800, 600))
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        self.media_ctrl = wx.media.MediaCtrl(self.panel)
        
        self.video_sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        self.video_sizer.Add(self.media_ctrl, 1, flag=wx.EXPAND)
        self.panel.SetSizerAndFit(self.video_sizer)
        self.Show()
```

In the above code, we define a frame for our application and create a panel inside it. Inside the panel, we create an instance of `wx.media.MediaCtrl` to display the video feed. We also define a box sizer to layout the video feed in the frame.

# Adding Video Conferencing Functionality

To enable video conferencing functionality, we will need to integrate a video streaming library such as **OpenCV**. OpenCV provides robust support for capturing and processing video streams.

Here is an example code snippet that adds video conferencing functionality to our application:

```python
import cv2

class VideoConferenceFrame(VideoConferenceFrame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(VideoConferenceFrame, self).__init__(parent, title)
        
        # Capture video feed
        self.capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
        
        # Start video streaming
        self.start_streaming()
        
    def start_streaming(self):
        while True:
            ret, frame = self.capture.read()
            if not ret:
                break
            
            # Convert the OpenCV frame to WXImage
            wx_frame = wx.Image(frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0])
            wx_frame.SetData(frame.tostring())
            
            # Display video feed in the MediaCtrl
            self.media_ctrl.SetBitmap(wx_frame.ConvertToBitmap())
            
            # Refresh the frame to update the video feed
            self.panel.Refresh()
```

In the above code, we import the `cv2` library to capture the video feed from the user's webcam. We define a `start_streaming` method that continuously captures frames from the webcam, converts them to WXImage format, and updates the video feed in the `wx.media.MediaCtrl`.

# Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a basic video conference application using WXPython. With this application, you can create a platform for remote communication and video conferencing. Feel free to enhance the application by adding features like audio support, chat functionality, or screen sharing.

Remember to learn more about WXPython and explore its extensive functionalities. Happy coding!
