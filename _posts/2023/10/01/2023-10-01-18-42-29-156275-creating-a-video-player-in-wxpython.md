In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a video player using the WXPython library. WXPython is a Python wrapper for the wxWidgets C++ GUI library, which allows us to easily build cross-platform desktop applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 and above)
- WXPython library

## Installing WXPython

To install WXPython, you can use a package manager such as pip. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install wxPython
```

## Building the Video Player

Now that we have WXPython installed, let's start building our video player. Create a new Python file, and let's import the necessary libraries:

```python
import wx

class VideoPlayer(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(VideoPlayer, self).__init__(parent, title=title, size=(800, 600))
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        self.mediaCtrl = wx.media.MediaCtrl(self.panel)        

app = wx.App()
videoPlayer = VideoPlayer(None, "Video Player")
videoPlayer.Show()
app.MainLoop()
```

In the above code, we import the `wx` library and define a class called `VideoPlayer` that inherits from the `wx.Frame` class. We initialize the frame with a panel and a media control object.

Now, let's add a basic interface to our video player:

```python
# ...

class VideoPlayer(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(VideoPlayer, self).__init__(parent, title=title, size=(800, 600))
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        self.mediaCtrl = wx.media.MediaCtrl(self.panel)

        self.filePicker = wx.FilePickerCtrl(self.panel, style=wx.FLP_USE_TEXTCTRL)
        self.playButton = wx.Button(self.panel, label="Play")
        self.stopButton = wx.Button(self.panel, label="Stop")

        self.playButton.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.onPlay)
        self.stopButton.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.onStop)

        self.setupLayout()

    def setupLayout(self):
        vbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        hbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.HORIZONTAL)

        vbox.Add(self.filePicker, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 5)
        vbox.Add(self.mediaCtrl, 1, wx.EXPAND | wx.ALL, 5)

        hbox.Add(self.playButton, 0, wx.ALIGN_LEFT | wx.ALL, 5)
        hbox.Add(self.stopButton, 0, wx.ALIGN_LEFT | wx.ALL, 5)

        vbox.Add(hbox, 0, wx.ALIGN_LEFT)

        self.panel.SetSizer(vbox)

    def onPlay(self, event):
        filepath = self.filePicker.GetPath()
        self.mediaCtrl.Load(filepath)
        self.mediaCtrl.Play()

    def onStop(self, event):
        self.mediaCtrl.Stop()
```

In this modified code, we add a `FilePickerCtrl` which allows the user to select a video file to play. We also add `Play` and `Stop` buttons and bind them to their respective event handlers.

Finally, we define the event handlers `onPlay` and `onStop` to load the selected video file and play/stop the video.

## Running the Video Player

To run the video player, save the code in a file such as `video_player.py` and execute it using the Python interpreter:

```
python video_player.py
```

This will open a video player window where you can select and play a video file.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a video player using WXPython. Feel free to enhance it by adding additional features, such as volume control or seeking functionality.
