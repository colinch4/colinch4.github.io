In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a calendar control using the WXPython library. The calendar control allows users to select dates easily and efficiently in an application. 

## Installation

Before we can start creating our calendar control, we need to install the WXPython library. To do this, we can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```python
pip install wxpython
```

## Importing the WXPython Library

Once we have installed WXPython, we can import the necessary classes and functions for creating our calendar control. Open your Python script and add the following import statement:

```python
import wx
```

## Creating a Calendar Control

Now, let's create the actual calendar control. We will use the `wx.CalendarCtrl` class to achieve this. In the initialization of our main app window, let's add the following code:

```python
class MyApp(wx.App):
    def OnInit(self):
        frame = MyFrame(None, title="Calendar Control")
        frame.Show(True)
        return True

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, title=title)
        panel = wx.Panel(self)

        # Create a calendar control
        calendar = wx.CalendarCtrl(panel, style=wx.CAL_SHOW_HOLIDAYS)
        calendar.SetDate(wx.DateTime.Today())

        sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        sizer.Add(calendar, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER|wx.ALL, 10)
        panel.SetSizer(sizer)

app = MyApp()
app.MainLoop()
```

## Explanation

Let's examine the code step by step:

- First, we create a new class, `MyApp`, that inherits from `wx.App`. This class will be used to initialize our application.
- Inside the `MyApp` class, we define the `OnInit` method where we create an instance of `MyFrame`, our main application window, and show it.
- The `MyFrame` class inherits from `wx.Frame` and has an `__init__` method that initializes the window and creates a panel for holding our controls.
- Inside the `__init__` method, we create an instance of `wx.CalendarCtrl` and set its style to `wx.CAL_SHOW_HOLIDAYS` to display holiday dates.
- We set the initial date of the calendar control to today's date using `calendar.SetDate(wx.DateTime.Today())`.
- Finally, we add the calendar control to a sizer and set this sizer as the sizer for our panel.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a calendar control using the WXPython library. The calendar control is a useful user interface element for date selection in applications. We explored the necessary steps to install the library, import the required modules, and create the calendar control. You can further enhance the calendar control by adding event handlers and customizing its appearance.
