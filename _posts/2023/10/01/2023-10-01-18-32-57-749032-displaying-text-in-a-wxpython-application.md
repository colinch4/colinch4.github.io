**Labels**
Labels are a common way to display static text in a WXPython application. They can be used to provide information or instructions to the user. Labels are simple and easy to use, but they are not meant for user input.

To create a label in WXPython, you can use the `wx.StaticText` class. Here's an example:

```python
import wx

app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(None, title="Text Display Example", size=(300, 200))

label = wx.StaticText(frame, label="Welcome to WXPython!")
frame.Show()

app.MainLoop()
```

In this example, a simple WXPython application is created with a frame. Then, a `wx.StaticText` object is created and added to the frame with the desired text. Finally, the frame is shown, and the application enters the main event loop using `app.MainLoop()`.

**Static Text Controls**
If you need to display text that can be modified by the user, you can use static text controls. Static text controls allow the user to select and copy the displayed text but do not allow editing.

To create a static text control in WXPython, you can use the `wx.TextCtrl` class with the `wx.TE_READONLY` style. Here's an example:

```python
import wx

app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(None, title="Text Display Example", size=(300, 200))

text_ctrl = wx.TextCtrl(frame, style=wx.TE_READONLY)
text_ctrl.SetValue("This is a static text control.")

frame.Show()

app.MainLoop()
```

In this example, a `wx.TextCtrl` object is created with the `wx.TE_READONLY` style. Then, the text value is set using the `SetValue()` method. The rest of the code is similar to the label example.

**Rich Text Controls**
If you need more advanced text formatting, such as bold, italic, or different font styles, you can use rich text controls in WXPython. The `wx.richtext.RichTextCtrl` class provides this functionality.

```python
import wx
import wx.richtext as rt

app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(None, title="Text Display Example", size=(300, 200))

rt_ctrl = rt.RichTextCtrl(frame, style=wx.VSCROLL | wx.HSCROLL | wx.NO_BORDER)
rt_ctrl.Freeze()
rt_ctrl.BeginSuppressUndo()
rt_ctrl.BeginParagraphSpacing(15, 0)
rt_ctrl.BeginBold()

paragraph = "This is a rich text control."
rt_ctrl.WriteText(paragraph)

rt_ctrl.EndBold()
rt_ctrl.EndSuppressUndo()
rt_ctrl.Thaw()
frame.Show()

app.MainLoop()
```

In this example, a `RichTextCtrl` object is created with some additional styles for vertical and horizontal scrolling, as well as removing the border. The `Freeze()` and `Thaw()` methods are called to prevent screen updates while changing text styles. The `BeginSuppressUndo()` and `EndSuppressUndo()` methods minimize the memory usage. Finally, the `BeginBold()`, `WriteText()`, and `EndBold()` methods are used to write a formatted paragraph to the control.

Remember, when displaying text in your WXPython application, consider the purpose and functionality needed. Choose the option that best suits your requirements - a simple label, a static text control, or a rich text control.
