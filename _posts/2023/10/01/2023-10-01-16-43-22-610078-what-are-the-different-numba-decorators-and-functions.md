Numba provides various decorators and functions that can be used to optimize and accelerate numerical computations. Some of the commonly used Numba decorators and functions include:

1. `@jit`: The `@jit` decorator is used to explicitly compile a Python function to machine code. It can be used with different compilation modes such as `nopython`, which requires the function to be entirely compilable to machine code without using any Python features, or `objectmode`, which allows the use of Python objects and features.

Example usage:
```python
from numba import jit

@jit
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Function body
    return result
```

2. `@vectorize`: The `@vectorize` decorator is used to create a Numba universal function that can be applied element-wise to NumPy arrays or other array-like objects. It allows for efficient parallelization of array operations and automatic type inference.

Example usage:
```python
import numpy as np
from numba import vectorize

@vectorize
def my_vectorized_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Element-wise operation
    return result

# Applying the vectorized function to a NumPy array
result_array = my_vectorized_function(array1, array2)
```

3. `@guvectorize`: The `@guvectorize` decorator is similar to `@vectorize`, but it allows for the creation of generalized ufuncs that can operate on multiple input arrays. It provides explicit control over the input and output types, and allows for looping over multiple dimensions.

Example usage:
```python
import numpy as np
from numba import guvectorize

@guvectorize(['void(float64[:], float64[:], float64[:])'], '(n),(n)->(n)')
def my_guvectorized_function(arr1, arr2, out):
    for i in range(arr1.shape[0]):
        # Element-wise operation
        out[i] = result

# Applying the guvectorized function to NumPy arrays
result_array = my_guvectorized_function(array1, array2)
```

These are just a few examples of the decorators and functions provided by Numba. Each of these decorators and functions has different use cases and can greatly enhance the performance of numerical computations in Python.
