In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a simple text editor using the WXPython library. WXPython is a Python wrapper for the popular cross-platform GUI library, wxWidgets.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into creating the text editor, let's make sure we have WXPython installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install wxPython
```

Now that we have WXPython installed, we can proceed with building our text editor.

## Creating the Text Editor Window

Here's a basic skeleton to start with:

```python
import wx

class TextEditor(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(TextEditor, self).__init__(parent, title=title, size=(800, 600))
        self.panel = wx.Panel(self)
        self.text_ctrl = wx.TextCtrl(self.panel, style=wx.TE_MULTILINE)
        self.init_ui()

    def init_ui(self):
        sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)
        sizer.Add(self.text_ctrl, 1, wx.EXPAND)
        self.panel.SetSizer(sizer)
        self.Centre()
        self.Show(True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = wx.App()
    TextEditor(None, title='Text Editor')
    app.MainLoop()
```

Let's go through the code:

1. We import the necessary modules: `wx` to create the GUI elements.

2. We define a new class `TextEditor` that inherits from `wx.Frame`, representing our main application window.

3. In the `init` method, we call the parent constructor and set the window title and size. We also create a panel to hold our text control.

4. The `init_ui` method sets up the user interface by creating a sizer, adding the text control to it with a proportion of 1 (to expand to fill the available space), and setting the sizer on the panel.

5. We center the window on the screen and show it.

6. Finally, in the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block, we create an instance of the `TextEditor` class and start the main event loop.

## Adding Additional Functionality

Now that we have a basic text editor window, we can add additional functionality such as file I/O operations, toolbar buttons, and menu items for actions like saving and opening files.

Here's an example of adding a toolbar and menu with save and open functionality:

```python
import wx

class TextEditor(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        # ... previous code

        self.create_toolbar()
        self.create_menu()

    def create_toolbar(self):
        toolbar = self.CreateToolBar(wx.TB_DEFAULT_STYLE)
        toolbar.AddTool(wx.ID_SAVE, 'Save', wx.Bitmap('save.png'))
        toolbar.AddTool(wx.ID_OPEN, 'Open', wx.Bitmap('open.png'))
        toolbar.Realize()

    def create_menu(self):
        menubar = wx.MenuBar()
        file_menu = wx.Menu()
        file_menu.Append(wx.ID_SAVE, '&Save\tCtrl+S')
        file_menu.Append(wx.ID_OPEN, '&Open\tCtrl+O')
        menubar.Append(file_menu, '&File')

        self.SetMenuBar(menubar)

        self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_save, id=wx.ID_SAVE)
        self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.on_open, id=wx.ID_OPEN)

    def on_save(self, event):
        with wx.FileDialog(self, "Save Text File", wildcard="Text files (*.txt)|*.txt",
                           style=wx.FD_SAVE | wx.FD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT) as file_dialog:
            if file_dialog.ShowModal() == wx.ID_CANCEL:
                return
            filepath = file_dialog.GetPath()
            text = self.text_ctrl.GetValue()
            try:
                with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
                    file.write(text)
            except IOError:
                wx.LogError("Cannot save file '%s'." % filepath)

    def on_open(self, event):
        with wx.FileDialog(self, "Open Text File", wildcard="Text files (*.txt)|*.txt",
                           style=wx.FD_OPEN | wx.FD_FILE_MUST_EXIST) as file_dialog:
            if file_dialog.ShowModal() == wx.ID_CANCEL:
                return
            filepath = file_dialog.GetPath()
            try:
                with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
                    text = file.read()
                    self.text_ctrl.SetValue(text)
            except IOError:
                wx.LogError("Cannot open file '%s'." % filepath)

    # ... previous code

```

In the code snippet above, we create a toolbar with save and open buttons. We also create a 'File' menu with save and open options. We bind the buttons and menu items to event handlers `on_save` and `on_open`, where we prompt the user for file selection, and perform the corresponding file I/O operations.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple text editor using WXPython. We started by setting up the environment and creating a basic text editor window. Then, we added additional functionality such as toolbar buttons and menu items for saving and opening files.

By customizing the code further, you can expand the text editor with features like copy-paste functionality, syntax highlighting, and more. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your imagination!
