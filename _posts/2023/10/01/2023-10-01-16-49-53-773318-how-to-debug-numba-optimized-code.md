## 1. Understand Numba limitations
Before diving into debugging, it's important to be aware of a few limitations of Numba that can affect your debugging process. First, Numba's error messages are not always as informative as regular Python error messages. Second, some features and libraries may not be fully compatible with Numba, so complex code involving these features may not work as expected.

## 2. Use the "nopython" mode
Numba provides two compilation modes: "nopython" and "object". The "nopython" mode produces the most optimized code but can make debugging more challenging. To enable easier debugging, you can temporarily switch to the "object" mode, which generates slower but more manageable code.

```python
@njit
def my_numba_function():
    # Your code here

# Temporarily switch to "object" mode
with njit(objmode=True):
    my_numba_function()
```

## 3. Print statements and assertions
Adding print statements and assertions is a common technique for debugging regular Python code, and it can also be useful when debugging Numba-optimized code. By selectively printing variable values or adding assertions to check certain conditions, you can gain insights into the behavior of your code.

```python
from numba import njit

@njit
def my_numba_function():
    x = 10
    y = 20
    print(x, y)  # Print variable values
    assert x > y  # Add assertions to check conditions

my_numba_function()
```

## 4. Use Numba's "settrace" function
Numba provides a built-in "settrace" function that allows you to set a callback function to be invoked by the JIT compiler during execution. This callback function can be used for debugging purposes, such as printing variable values or stepping through code execution.

```python
from numba import njit, settrace

@njit
def my_numba_function():
    x = 10
    y = 20
    settrace(print)  # Set callback function to print variable values
    result = x + y
    return result

my_numba_function()
```

## Conclusion
Debugging Numba-optimized code may require some extra effort due to its JIT compilation and optimizations. However, by understanding Numba's limitations and using techniques like print statements, assertions, and the "settrace" function, you can effectively debug your Numba-optimized code and identify and fix any issues that may arise.
