## Introduction

Numba is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Python that can significantly speed up your code. However, when optimizing code with Numba, it's important to measure and evaluate the performance gains achieved. In this blog post, we will explore various techniques for benchmarking Numba-optimized code.

## 1. Time Execution

The simplest and most common way to benchmark code is to measure the execution time. The `time` module in Python provides a straightforward way to do this. You can use the `time.time()` function to record the starting time, execute the code, and then subtract the starting time from the ending time to calculate the elapsed time.

Here's an example:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Your Numba-optimized code here

end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time

print(f"Execution time: {execution_time} seconds")
```

## 2. Repeat Execution

Benchmarking a single execution might not give a true representation of the performance of your Numba-optimized code, especially if it involves JIT compilation. A better approach is to repeat the execution multiple times and calculate the average execution time.

Here's an example of how you can repeat the execution using a loop:

```python
import time

num_repeats = 100

total_time = 0

for _ in range(num_repeats):
    start_time = time.time()

    # Your Numba-optimized code here

    end_time = time.time()
    execution_time = end_time - start_time

    total_time += execution_time

average_time = total_time / num_repeats

print(f"Average execution time: {average_time} seconds")
```

## 3. Use Benchmarking Libraries

There are several benchmarking libraries available that make it easier to measure the performance of Numba-optimized code. Two popular libraries are `pytest-benchmark` and `perf`.

`pytest-benchmark` integrates with the `pytest` testing framework and provides a simple way to write benchmark tests. It automatically repeats the execution and provides statistical measurements.

`perf` is a more advanced and flexible benchmarking library that offers additional features such as tracking memory usage and CPU performance counters.

## Conclusion

Benchmarks are essential to assess the performance improvements achieved by using Numba to optimize your code. By measuring the execution time and repeating the execution multiple times, you can get a more accurate representation of the performance gains. Additionally, using benchmarking libraries like `pytest-benchmark` or `perf` can provide more advanced measurement capabilities. Happy benchmarking!
