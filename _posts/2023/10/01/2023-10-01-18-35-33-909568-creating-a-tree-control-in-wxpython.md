## Introduction

WXPython is a powerful toolkit for creating desktop applications using Python. One of its useful features is the ability to create a tree control, which allows you to display hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a tree control in WXPython.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have WXPython installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install wxPython
```

## Step 1: Importing the necessary modules

Let's start by importing the necessary modules for creating a tree control:

```python
import wx
```

## Step 2: Creating the main application class

Next, we need to create a class for our main application window:

```python
class TreeControlApp(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        super(TreeControlApp, self).__init__(parent, title=title, size=(400, 300))

        self.tree = wx.TreeCtrl(self)
        
        self.create_tree()
        
        self.Centre()
        self.Show()

    def create_tree(self):
        # Add root node
        root = self.tree.AddRoot("Root")
        
        # Add child nodes
        child1 = self.tree.AppendItem(root, "Child 1")
        child2 = self.tree.AppendItem(root, "Child 2")
        
        # Add sub-child nodes
        subchild1 = self.tree.AppendItem(child1, "Sub-child 1")
        subchild2 = self.tree.AppendItem(child1, "Sub-child 2")

        # Expand the root node
        self.tree.Expand(root)
```

## Step 3: Creating the application

Now, let's create our application and run it:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = wx.App()
    TreeControlApp(None, "Tree Control Example")
    app.MainLoop()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a tree control in WXPython. We started by importing the necessary modules, then created a main application class that contains the tree control. Finally, we created the application and ran it. Feel free to build upon this example and explore more features of the tree control. Happy coding!
