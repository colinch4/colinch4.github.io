When working with TensorFlow, it is important to understand the concept of placeholders. Placeholders are used to feed data into TensorFlow computational graphs during the execution of a session. They allow you to define the shape and type of the input data without actually providing the values right away.

Placeholders are especially useful when building models that require variable input data, such as in machine learning tasks where input data can change between different training examples.

In Python, you can use the TensorFlow library to create and work with placeholders. Here's an example of how to use placeholders in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder for input data
input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784])

# Define a placeholder for target labels
target_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])

# ... build your TensorFlow model using the placeholders ...

# Run a TensorFlow session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Create input data and labels
    input_data = ...  # Your input data
    target_labels = ...  # Your target labels
    
    # Define the feed dictionary to pass data into the placeholders
    feed_dict = {
        input_placeholder: input_data,
        target_placeholder: target_labels
    }
    
    # Run your TensorFlow model using the feed dictionary
    output = sess.run(your_model_output, feed_dict=feed_dict)
```

In the example above, we created two placeholders: `input_placeholder` for input data and `target_placeholder` for target labels. 

We used the `tf.placeholder` function to define the shape and type of the placeholders. The `shape` parameter represents the shape of the input data, where `None` indicates a variable size for that dimension. The `tf.float32` and `tf.int32` indicate the data type of the placeholders.

During the execution of the session, we created input data and labels and defined a `feed_dict` dictionary to pass these values into the placeholders. We then ran our TensorFlow model using the `sess.run` function, providing the placeholders and feed dictionary as arguments.

Placeholders are a fundamental concept in TensorFlow that provide flexibility and ease of use when working with variable input data. By using placeholders, you can create dynamic computational graphs that adapt to the data provided during the execution of a session.
