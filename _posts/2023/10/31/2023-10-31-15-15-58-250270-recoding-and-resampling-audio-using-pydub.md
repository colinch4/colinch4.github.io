In audio processing, recoding and resampling are common tasks that involve changing the properties of audio files. Pydub is a Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for working with audio files. In this blog post, we will explore how to recode and resample audio using Pydub.

# Installing Pydub
To get started, we need to install Pydub. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install pydub
```

# Recoding Audio
Recoding audio refers to changing the audio codec or format of an audio file. Pydub makes it simple to recode audio by providing a `export` method that allows us to specify the codec and file format.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to recode an audio file to the WAV format:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.mp3")

# Recode the audio to the WAV format
recoded_audio = audio.export("output.wav", format="wav")
```

In the example above, we load an audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file` and then use the `export` method to save it in the WAV format. You can replace "input.mp3" with the path to your own audio file.

# Resampling Audio
Resampling audio involves changing the sampling rate (number of samples per second) of an audio file. Pydub provides a `set_frame_rate` method that allows us to resample audio.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to resample an audio file to a different sampling rate:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.wav")

# Resample the audio to 44100 Hz
resampled_audio = audio.set_frame_rate(44100)
```

In the example above, we load an audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file` and then use the `set_frame_rate` method to resample it to a sampling rate of 44100 Hz. You can replace "input.wav" with the path to your own audio file.

# Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to recode and resample audio using Pydub. We saw how to recode audio to a different codec and file format, as well as how to resample audio to a different sampling rate. Pydub provides a simple and convenient way to perform these audio processing tasks in Python.
