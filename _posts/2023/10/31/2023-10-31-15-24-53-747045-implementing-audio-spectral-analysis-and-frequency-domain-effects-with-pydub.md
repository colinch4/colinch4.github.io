Audio spectral analysis is the process of analyzing the frequency contents of an audio signal. It allows us to understand the distribution of different frequencies present in the audio and is a crucial step in various audio processing tasks.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform audio spectral analysis and apply frequency domain effects using the Pydub library in Python.

## Introduction to Pydub

Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use audio processing library for Python. It provides a high-level interface over various audio manipulation tasks, making it convenient for performing audio editing, analysis, and effects.

To get started, you can install Pydub using pip:

```python
pip install pydub
```

Pydub supports multiple audio formats and provides methods to load and manipulate audio files. It also provides utilities for performing common audio tasks like slicing, concatenating, and fading.

## Performing Audio Spectral Analysis

To perform audio spectral analysis using Pydub, we need to convert the audio signal to the frequency domain. Pydub supports Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the audio from the time domain to the frequency domain.

Here's an example of how to perform audio spectral analysis using Pydub:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("audio.wav")

# Perform FFT to get the frequency domain representation
samples = audio.get_array_of_samples()
n = len(samples)  # Number of samples

# Apply FFT to convert to frequency domain
spectrum = np.fft.fft(samples)
frequencies = np.fft.fftfreq(n, d=1/audio.frame_rate)

# Plot the spectrum
plt.plot(frequencies, np.abs(spectrum))
plt.xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.title('Audio Spectrum')
plt.show()
```

In the above example, we load an audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file` and get the array of samples from the audio data. We then perform FFT using `np.fft.fft` to convert the samples to the frequency domain. Finally, we plot the spectrum using `plt.plot` to visualize the frequency distribution.

## Applying Frequency Domain Effects

Once we have the audio signal in the frequency domain, we can apply various frequency domain effects. Common effects include filtering, equalization, and spectral manipulation.

Here's an example of how to apply a basic low-pass filter using Pydub:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("audio.wav")

# Apply a low-pass filter
filtered = audio.low_pass_filter(1000)  # Cut-off frequency of 1000 Hz

# Export the filtered audio
filtered.export("filtered_audio.wav", format="wav")
```

In the above example, we load an audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file` and apply a low-pass filter using `audio.low_pass_filter`. The `low_pass_filter` method allows us to specify the cut-off frequency beyond which the high frequencies are attenuated. Finally, we export the filtered audio using `filtered.export`.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to perform audio spectral analysis and apply frequency domain effects using the Pydub library in Python. Pydub makes it convenient to work with audio signals and provides powerful features for audio manipulation.

By leveraging the capabilities of Pydub, you can explore and implement various audio processing tasks with ease.
