Analyzing the harmony and detecting chords in audio signals can be a challenging task. However, with the help of the Pydub library in Python, we can easily perform audio processing and extract valuable information such as pitch and chords.

In this tutorial, we will go through the process of implementing audio harmony analysis and chord detection using Pydub. We will assume that Pydub is already installed in your Python environment.

## Audio Analysis with Pydub

First, let's start by loading an audio file using Pydub and converting it to a format that can be analyzed:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.utils import make_chunks

audio_file = "path/to/audio/file.wav"
audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(audio_file)

# Split audio into chunks for analysis
chunks = make_chunks(audio, 1000)  # split every 1 second
```

We have loaded the audio file and split it into chunks of 1 second each for analysis. Now, let's move on to extracting pitch information.

## Extracting Pitch Information

To analyze the pitch of each audio chunk, we can utilize the `pydub.audio_segment.AudioSegment` class's `frequncy_changed()` method. This method returns the frequency of the audio chunk as a NumPy array.

```python
import numpy as np

for chunk in chunks:
    # Convert audio chunk to mono for pitch analysis
    chunk = chunk.set_channels(1)
    
    # Convert audio chunk to numpy array
    arr = np.array(chunk.get_array_of_samples())
    
    # Calculate frequency using Fourier Transform
    frequency = np.fft.fft(arr)
    
    # Process the frequency information for analysis
    # ...
```

Within the loop, we convert the audio chunk to mono to simplify the analysis. Then, we convert the chunk to a NumPy array and perform a Fourier Transform on it to obtain the frequency information. From here, we can process the frequency information to analyze the pitch and identify chords.

## Chord Detection

Chord detection involves analyzing the pitch information and identifying the underlying chords being played in the audio. There are various algorithms and techniques available for chord detection, but one common approach is to utilize the chroma feature.

Pydub provides a convenient way to extract the chroma feature using the `pydub.utils.audioop` module. Here's an example of how to extract the chroma feature:

```python
from pydub.utils import audioop

for chunk in chunks:
    # Convert audio chunk to mono for pitch analysis
    chunk = chunk.set_channels(1)
    
    # Convert audio chunk to numpy array
    arr = np.array(chunk.get_array_of_samples())
    
    # Calculate frequency using Fourier Transform
    frequency = np.fft.fft(arr)
    
    # Calculate chroma feature
    chroma = audioop.chroma(arr, chunk.sample_width, 0, chunk.frame_width)
    
    # Process the chroma feature for chord detection
    # ...
```

Once we have the chroma feature for each chunk, we can proceed with analyzing it to detect chords. This can involve techniques such as template matching, machine learning algorithms, or probabilistic models.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to implement audio harmony analysis and chord detection using Pydub. We learned how to load audio files, split them into chunks, extract pitch information, and detect chords using the chroma feature. The implementation of chord detection can vary depending on the specific requirements and techniques employed.

By leveraging the power of Pydub and its audio processing capabilities, we can easily perform complex audio analysis tasks like harmony analysis and chord detection.
