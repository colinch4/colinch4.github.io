Audio manipulation is a common task in various multimedia applications. Pydub is a powerful Python library that allows us to process audio files easily. In this tutorial, we will explore how to reverse and flip audio using Pydub.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Pydub installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install pydub
```

## Reversing Audio

Reversing an audio file means playing it backward. We can achieve this using the `reverse()` function provided by Pydub. Let's see an example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input_audio.wav")

# Reverse the audio
reversed_audio = audio.reverse()

# Export the reversed audio
reversed_audio.export("reversed_audio.wav", format="wav")
```

In the code above, we first load the audio file using the `from_file()` function. Then, we call the `reverse()` function to reverse the audio. Finally, we export the reversed audio using the `export()` function, specifying the desired file format.

## Flipping Audio

Flipping an audio file means turning it upside down, swapping the left and right channels. Pydub provides the `split_to_mono()` and `pan()` functions to achieve this. Here's an example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input_audio.wav")

# Split the audio into mono
left_channel, right_channel = audio.split_to_mono()

# Flip the left and right channels
flipped_audio = right_channel.pan(-1) + left_channel.pan(1)

# Export the flipped audio
flipped_audio.export("flipped_audio.wav", format="wav")
```

In the code snippet above, we start by loading the audio file. Then, we split it into separate left and right channels using the `split_to_mono()` function. After that, we flip the audio by panning the left channel to the right (-1) and the right channel to the left (1). Finally, we export the flipped audio.

## Conclusion

Pydub provides a simple and straightforward way to reverse and flip audio files. Using the `reverse()` function, we can play the audio backward. By splitting the audio into mono and using the `pan()` function, we can flip the audio by swapping the left and right channels. Pydub's ease of use makes it a great choice for audio processing tasks in Python.

Give it a try and unleash your creativity with audio manipulation!
