# Introduction to Audio Score Following

Audio score following is the process of synchronizing a performance with a musical score in real-time. It involves continuously comparing the audio input to the corresponding sheet music and updating the position accordingly.

Automatic music transcription, on the other hand, is the process of converting an audio recording of music into a symbolic notation representation, such as MIDI. It involves extracting pitch, rhythm, and other musical elements from the audio.

# Automatic Music Transcription Process

Before diving into the implementation details, let's understand the high-level process of automatic music transcription:

1. **Pre-processing:** The audio signal is pre-processed to enhance its quality and remove noise.
2. **Pitch Estimation:** The pitch of each note in the audio is estimated. This involves detecting the fundamental frequency of the notes.
3. **Note Segmentation:** The audio is segmented into individual notes or musical events based on the estimated pitch and other features.
4. **Duration Estimation:** The duration of each note is estimated based on the timing between segments.
5. **Symbolic Notation Conversion:** Finally, the estimated pitch and duration information is converted into a symbolic notation representation, such as MIDI.

# Implementing Audio Score Following with Pydub

Pydub is a powerful audio processing library that provides easy-to-use functions for manipulating audio files. It is built on top of the FFmpeg library and supports a variety of audio formats.

Here is an example of how to implement audio score following using Pydub:

```python
import pydub

# Load the audio file
audio = pydub.AudioSegment.from_file("audio.wav")

# Load the musical score
score = load_score("score.xml")

# Define the current position in the score
current_position = 0

# Define the sample rate and frame size
sample_rate = audio.frame_rate
frame_size = audio.frame_width

# Iterate over the audio frames
for frame in audio:
    # Compare the current audio frame with corresponding score frame
    score_frame = score[current_position]

    # Calculate the similarity between the audio frame and score frame

    # Update the current position in the score based on similarity

    # Update the output audio with the synchronized frame

# Save the output audio file
output_audio.export("output.wav", format="wav")
```

In this example, we first load the audio file and the musical score. Then, we define the current position in the score and iterate over the audio frames. For each frame, we compare it with the corresponding frame in the score, calculate the similarity, and update the current position accordingly. Finally, we save the synchronized audio to an output file.

# Implementing Automatic Music Transcription with Pydub

To implement automatic music transcription, we can build on top of audio score following. Here is a high-level overview of the process:

1. Pre-process the audio using techniques like noise removal and equalization.
2. Estimate the pitch of each note using pitch detection algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or Harmonic Product Spectrum (HPS).
3. Segment the audio into individual notes or musical events based on the estimated pitch and other features.
4. Estimate the duration of each note by analyzing the timing between segments.
5. Convert the estimated pitch and duration information into a symbolic notation representation, such as MIDI.

Depending on the complexity of the music and the accuracy requirements, you may need to fine-tune the parameters and algorithms used in each step.

# Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio score following and automatic music transcription using the Pydub library in Python. We discussed the high-level process of automatic music transcription and provided example code for both audio score following and automatic music transcription. By automating the transcription process, we can save time and effort while preserving the musicality of the original performance.
