When working with audio files in Python, Pydub is a powerful library that provides an easy-to-use interface. One common requirement in audio applications is to have playback controls for the audio file, such as play, pause, and stop. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement audio playback controls using Pydub.

## Introduction to Pydub

Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use library that allows you to manipulate audio files in various formats, such as WAV, MP3, and more. It provides an object-oriented interface to work with elements like audio segments, mixers, and effects.

To get started, you can install Pydub using pip:

```bash
pip install pydub
```

Once installed, you can import the library in your Python script:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
```

## Initializing the audio file

First, let's initialize the audio file that we want to play. Pydub supports various audio formats, so make sure the file is in a compatible format. To load the audio file, use the `AudioSegment.from_file` method:

```python
audio_file = "path/to/audio_file.mp3"  # Replace with your audio file path
audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file)
```

## Implementing the playback controls

### Play

To play the audio file, we can use the `play` method from the `AudioSegment` class. This method will play the audio using the default system player:

```python
audio.play()
```

### Pause

To pause the audio playback, we need to keep track of the current position in the audio file and stop the playback. We can do this by storing the starting time of the audio file and the elapsed time during playback. Here's an example:

```python
from pydub import playback

start_time = 0
elapsed_time = 0

def play_audio():
    global start_time, elapsed_time
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file)
    audio = audio[start_time:]  # Play from the current position
    
    # Start playback from the current position
    playback.play(audio)
    
    # Calculate the elapsed time during playback
    elapsed_time = audio.duration_seconds

def pause_audio():
    global start_time, elapsed_time
    playback.stop()
    start_time += elapsed_time  # Update the starting time

# Usage:
play_audio()   # Starts playing the audio
pause_audio()  # Pauses the audio playback
```

### Stop

To stop the audio playback, we can use the `stop` method from the `playback` module:

```python
from pydub import playback

def stop_audio():
    playback.stop()

# Usage:
stop_audio()  # Stops the audio playback
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement audio playback controls using Pydub. We initialized the audio file and then implemented functions to play, pause, and stop the audio playback. Pydub provides a straightforward interface to control audio playback, making it easy to integrate in your Python projects.
