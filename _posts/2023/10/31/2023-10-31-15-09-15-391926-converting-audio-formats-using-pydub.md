## Introduction
With Pydub, you can easily perform various audio processing tasks, including converting audio file formats. It provides a high-level interface for manipulating audio data, making it a popular choice among Python developers for audio-related projects.

## Installing Pydub
Before getting started, make sure you have Pydub installed on your system. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```shell
pip install pydub
```

## Converting Audio Formats
First, let's see an example of converting an audio file from one format to another using Pydub. In this case, we will convert an MP3 file to WAV format.

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the MP3 file
mp3_file = AudioSegment.from_file("input.mp3", format="mp3")

# Export the MP3 file as WAV format
mp3_file.export("output.wav", format="wav")
```

In the above example, we first load the MP3 file using `AudioSegment.from_file()` method and specify the format as "mp3". Then, we use the `export()` method to save the audio as a WAV file, specifying the format as "wav" and the output file name as "output.wav".

Pydub supports a wide range of audio formats, such as WAV, MP3, FLAC, AIFF, and more. You can easily convert between different formats by specifying the desired input and output format in the appropriate methods.

## Conclusion
Converting audio file formats using Pydub is straightforward and efficient. Whether you need to convert MP3 to WAV, FLAC to MP3, or any other audio format conversion, Pydub provides a convenient way to achieve this task. It is a powerful library for audio processing in Python, and you can explore its other features for more advanced audio manipulation.
