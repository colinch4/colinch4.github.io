Resampling and sample rate conversion are essential techniques when working with digital audio processing. They allow you to change the sample rate of an audio signal to suit different purposes, such as converting from one format to another or adjusting the playback speed.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio resampling and sample rate conversion using Pydub, a powerful audio processing library for Python.

## Introduction to Pydub

Pydub is an easy-to-use audio processing library that provides a high-level interface for manipulating audio files. It supports various audio formats and provides functionalities such as slicing, concatenating, and applying effects to audio files.

To get started, you need to install Pydub using pip:

```shell
pip install pydub
```

Once installed, you can import the necessary modules and start using Pydub in your Python code:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play
```

## Resampling Audio with Pydub

Resampling refers to changing the sample rate of an audio signal. Pydub provides a simple way to resample audio using the `set_frame_rate()` method of the `AudioSegment` class.

Here's an example of how to resample an audio file to a different sample rate:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.wav")
resampled = audio.set_frame_rate(44100) # resample to 44.1 kHz
resampled.export("output.wav", format="wav")
```

In the above code, we first load the audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file()` and then use the `set_frame_rate()` method to resample the audio to the desired sample rate (in this case, 44.1 kHz). Finally, we export the resampled audio using `export()`.

## Sample Rate Conversion with Pydub

Sample rate conversion is the process of changing the sample rate of an audio signal while maintaining the pitch. Pydub provides a convenient method called `set_sample_width()` to perform sample rate conversion.

Here's an example of how to perform sample rate conversion on an audio file:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.wav")
converted = audio.set_sample_width(2) # convert to 16-bit audio
converted.export("output.wav", format="wav")
```

In the above code, we load the audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file()` and then use the `set_sample_width()` method to convert the audio to the desired sample width (in this case, 16 bits). Finally, we export the converted audio using `export()`.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have seen how to implement audio resampling and sample rate conversion using Pydub. These techniques are fundamental when working with digital audio processing and can be useful in various applications. Pydub provides a simple and intuitive way to perform these operations in Python. Give it a try and explore the numerous possibilities of audio manipulation with Pydub!
