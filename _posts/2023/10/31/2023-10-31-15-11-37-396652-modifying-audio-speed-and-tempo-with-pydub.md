## What is Pydub?
Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use audio processing library in Python. It provides a high-level interface to work with audio files and perform various audio manipulation tasks such as splitting, concatenating, adjusting volume, changing speed, and modifying tempo.

Pydub is built on top of other audio processing libraries such as FFmpeg and SoX, making it a versatile tool for working with audio in different formats.

## Modifying Audio Speed
Changing the speed of audio refers to altering the duration of the audio while maintaining the pitch. Pydub provides a straightforward way to modify the speed of audio files.

To change the speed of an audio file, we can use the `speedup` or `slowdown` methods in Pydub. Let's see an example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.mp3")

# Increase the speed by 10%
fast_audio = audio.speedup(percent=10)

# Save the modified audio
fast_audio.export("output.mp3", format="mp3")
```

In the above example, we load an audio file called `input.mp3`, increase the speed by 10% using the `speedup` method, and then export the modified audio to a new file called `output.mp3`.

## Modifying Audio Tempo
Changing the tempo of audio refers to altering the speed of playback while maintaining the original duration and pitch. Pydub offers the `time_stretch` method to modify the tempo of audio files.

Let's take a look at an example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file('input.mp3')

# Increase the tempo by 20%
fast_audio = audio.time_stretch(1.2)

# Save the modified audio
fast_audio.export('output.mp3', format='mp3')
```

In the above code snippet, we load an audio file called `input.mp3`, increase the tempo by 20% using the `time_stretch` method, and then export the modified audio to a new file called `output.mp3`.

## Conclusion
Modifying the speed and tempo of audio files can be easily achieved using Pydub. Whether you want to speed up or slow down the audio, Pydub provides simple methods to accomplish these tasks. It allows you to experiment with different audio effects and opens up opportunities for creative audio processing.

By leveraging the power of Pydub, you can build applications that involve audio manipulation, such as voice changers, podcast editing tools, or music players with speed control. Explore the Pydub documentation to discover more audio processing capabilities and unleash your creativity.
