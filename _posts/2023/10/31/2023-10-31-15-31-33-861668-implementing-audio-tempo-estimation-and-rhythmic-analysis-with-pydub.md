Audio tempo estimation and rhythmic analysis are essential tasks in music processing and analysis. They allow us to identify the tempo (or speed) of a musical piece and analyze its rhythmic patterns. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform audio tempo estimation and rhythmic analysis using the Pydub library in Python.

## Introduction to Pydub

Pydub is a Python library that provides a simple and intuitive interface to manipulate audio files. It offers functionalities for reading, writing, and processing various audio formats. Pydub makes it easy to perform audio manipulations such as slicing, concatenation, volume adjustment, and more.

## Audio Tempo Estimation

### Installing the required libraries

To get started, we need to install Pydub and librosa, a library for music and audio analysis. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pydub librosa
```

### Loading and analyzing audio

Let's begin by loading an audio file using Pydub and analyzing its properties:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

audio = AudioSegment.from_file("my_audio.wav")
duration = len(audio) / 1000  # Convert milliseconds to seconds
sample_rate = audio.frame_rate
channels = audio.channels

print(f"Duration: {duration} seconds")
print(f"Sample rate: {sample_rate} Hz")
print(f"Channels: {channels}")
```

This code loads an audio file named `my_audio.wav` and prints its duration, sample rate, and the number of channels.

### Estimating audio tempo

To estimate the audio tempo, we can use the tempo module of librosa. Here's an example of how it can be done:

```python
import librosa

y, sr = librosa.load("my_audio.wav")  # Load the audio file
tempo, beat_frames = librosa.beat.beat_track(y, sr=sr)  # Estimate the tempo

print(f"Tempo: {tempo} BPM")
```

This code uses librosa to load the audio file and estimate the tempo using the `beat.beat_track` function. The tempo is expressed in beats per minute (BPM).

## Rhythmic Analysis

### Extracting rhythmic features

Rhythmic analysis involves extracting rhythmic features from audio, such as beat positions and onset times. We can use librosa for this purpose. Here's an example:

```python
import librosa

y, sr = librosa.load("my_audio.wav")  # Load the audio file
tempo, beat_frames = librosa.beat.beat_track(y, sr=sr)  # Estimate the tempo

onset_frames = librosa.onset.onset_detect(y, sr=sr)  # Detect the onset frames
onset_times = librosa.frames_to_time(onset_frames, sr=sr)  # Convert frames to times

print(f"Tempo: {tempo} BPM")
print(f"Onset times: {onset_times}")
```

This code detects the onset frames in the audio using `librosa.onset.onset_detect` and converts them to corresponding times using `librosa.frames_to_time`. The onset times represent the moments when new musical events occur.

### Identifying rhythmic patterns

Once we have extracted the rhythmic features, we can analyze them to identify rhythmic patterns present in the audio. For instance, we can use clustering algorithms to group similar rhythmic patterns together.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

onset_times = np.array(onset_times).reshape(-1, 1)  # Reshape data for clustering

# Perform clustering
n_clusters = 4  # Number of clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters)
kmeans.fit(onset_times)

cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_

print(f"Cluster labels: {cluster_labels}")
```

In this code, we reshape the onset times data to fit the clustering algorithm's input requirements. We then use the KMeans clustering algorithm from scikit-learn to group the onset times into `n_clusters` clusters. The resulting `cluster_labels` can be used for further analysis or visualization.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio tempo estimation and rhythmic analysis using the Pydub library in Python. By leveraging Pydub's capabilities and the audio processing functions of librosa, we can estimate tempo, extract rhythmic features, and identify rhythmic patterns in audio files. This opens possibilities for various applications in music analysis, beat detection, and rhythm-based music processing. Happy coding!
