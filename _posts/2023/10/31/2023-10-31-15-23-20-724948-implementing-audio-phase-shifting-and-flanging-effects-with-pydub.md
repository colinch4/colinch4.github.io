Audio effects can enhance the listening experience and bring depth and character to a sound. Two popular effects are audio phase shifting and flanging. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement these effects using Pydub, a powerful audio processing library for Python.

## Introduction to Pydub

[Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) is a Python library that makes it easy to manipulate audio files. It provides a high-level interface for audio processing tasks such as playback, conversion, and effects. Pydub supports various audio formats and is built on top of industry-standard libraries like ffmpeg and pyAudio.

To get started, you'll need to install Pydub using pip:

```python
pip install pydub
```

Once installed, you can import Pydub in your Python script:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
```

## What is Audio Phase Shifting?

Audio phase shifting is an effect that alters the phase relationship between different frequencies in an audio signal. It creates a swirling, phaser-like sound by adding a time-delayed version of the original signal to itself. The time delay varies over time, creating a sweeping motion in the audio.

## Implementing Audio Phase Shifting

To implement audio phase shifting with Pydub, we'll use the `pan` method, which allows us to pan the audio to a specific position in the stereo field. By applying a varying pan position, we can create the phase-shifting effect.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates audio phase shifting:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

def apply_phase_shifting(audio_file, shift_amount):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file)
    shifted_audio = audio.pan(shift_amount)
    shifted_audio.export('output_audio.wav', format='wav')

# Usage
apply_phase_shifting('input_audio.wav', '0.5s')
```

In the above code, we load the input audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file` and then apply the `pan` method with a shifted amount. The `shift_amount` parameter determines the amount of phase shifting. The resulting audio is exported to a new WAV file using the `export` method.

## What is Flanging?

Flanging is another popular audio effect that creates a swirling, swooshing sound by introducing a slight time delay and mixing it with the original audio signal. This delay varies over time, creating a unique and dynamic sonic texture.

## Implementing Flanging

To implement flanging with Pydub, we'll use the `fade_in` and `fade_out` methods to create the time delay effect. We'll then mix the delayed audio with the original audio to produce the flanging effect.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates audio flanging:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

def apply_flanging(audio_file, delay_amount, fade_duration):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file)
    delayed_audio = audio.fade_in(fade_duration) + audio.fade_out(fade_duration)
    flanged_audio = audio.overlay(delayed_audio)
    flanged_audio.export('output_audio.wav', format='wav')

# Usage
apply_flanging('input_audio.wav', 50, 200)
```

In the above code, we load the input audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file`. We then create a time-delayed audio segment using the `fade_in` and `fade_out` methods, with a specified `fade_duration`. Finally, we overlay the delayed audio with the original audio using the `overlay` method. The resulting audio is exported to a new WAV file using the `export` method.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement audio phase shifting and flanging effects using Pydub. By leveraging Pydub's capabilities, we were able to manipulate audio files and apply these effects with just a few lines of code. Feel free to experiment with different parameters and explore more audio effects that Pydub has to offer!
