## Introduction

Audio metadata provides valuable information about an audio file, including details such as the artist, album, genre, and duration. In this blog post, we will explore how to extract and modify audio metadata using the Pydub library in Python.

## Installing Pydub

Before we dive into working with audio metadata, we need to install the Pydub library. You can install it using pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install pydub
```

## Extracting Audio Metadata

To extract audio metadata, we first need to load the audio file using Pydub. Let's assume we have an audio file called "song.mp3" in our current directory. Here's an example of how to extract metadata from this file:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

audio_file = "song.mp3"
audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file)

duration = audio.duration_seconds
artist = audio.get_metadata("artist")
album = audio.get_metadata("album")

print("Duration:", duration)
print("Artist:", artist)
print("Album:", album)
```

In the example above, we use the `AudioSegment.from_file()` method to load the audio file. We then use the `duration_seconds` property to retrieve the duration of the audio file in seconds. Additionally, we use the `get_metadata()` method to extract specific metadata fields such as the artist and album.

## Modifying Audio Metadata

Pydub also allows us to modify audio metadata. Let's say we want to update the artist name of our audio file "song.mp3" to "John Doe". Here's an example of how to achieve this:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

audio_file = "song.mp3"
audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_file)

audio.export(audio_file, tags={"artist": "John Doe"}, format="mp3")
```

In this example, we load the audio file using `AudioSegment.from_file()`. We then use the `export()` method to save the modified audio file. By passing the `tags` parameter, we can provide a dictionary of metadata fields and their new values. In this case, we update the artist field to "John Doe".

## Conclusion

Working with audio metadata is made easy with the Pydub library in Python. We can extract valuable information from audio files and modify metadata fields as needed. This enables us to organize and manage our audio collection effectively. So go ahead, give Pydub a try and explore the possibilities of working with audio metadata!
