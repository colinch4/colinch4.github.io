## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
Pydub wraps the FFmpeg library to provide a simple and intuitive interface for audio processing. It supports various audio formats and offers functions to manipulate audio files, such as slicing, concatenating, and exporting.

## Installing Pydub<a name="installing-pydub"></a>
To install Pydub, open your command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pydub
```

Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system, as Pydub requires it to handle audio files.

## Loading an Audio File<a name="loading-an-audio-file"></a>
Let's start by loading an audio file using Pydub. You can use the `AudioSegment` class to load audio files in various formats such as MP3, WAV, and FLAC.

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

audio = AudioSegment.from_file("audio.wav", format="wav")
```

In the above code, we load an audio file named "audio.wav" and specify the format as WAV.

## Extracting Audio Properties<a name="extracting-audio-properties"></a>
Pydub provides several methods to extract various audio properties. Here are a few examples:

### Analyzing Audio Duration<a name="analyzing-audio-duration"></a>
To get the duration of an audio file in milliseconds, you can use the `duration_seconds` attribute.

```python
duration = audio.duration_seconds * 1000
print(f"Duration: {duration} ms")
```

### Analyzing Audio Channels<a name="analyzing-audio-channels"></a>
To determine the number of channels in an audio file, you can use the `channels` attribute.

```python
channels = audio.channels
print(f"Channels: {channels}")
```

You can also check if an audio file is in stereo by using the `is_stereo` attribute.

```python
is_stereo = audio.is_stereo
print(f"Stereo: {is_stereo}")
```

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
In this blog post, we explored how to analyze audio properties using Pydub. We learned how to load an audio file, extract its duration, and determine the number of channels. Pydub provides a convenient interface to perform complex audio processing tasks, making it a valuable tool for audio analysis applications.
