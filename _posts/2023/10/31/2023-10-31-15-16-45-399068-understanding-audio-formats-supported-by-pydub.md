When working with audio files in Python, Pydub is a powerful library that provides a simplified interface for manipulating audio. However, it is important to understand the different audio formats supported by Pydub in order to work effectively with audio files.

Pydub supports a wide range of audio formats out of the box, including:

1. **MP3**: MP3 is a popular audio format known for its high compression rate without significant loss in audio quality. It is widely supported and playable on most devices and media players.

2. **WAV**: WAV is an uncompressed audio format that reproduces audio with high fidelity. It is commonly used for storing high-quality audio data without any loss of information.

3. **FLAC**: FLAC, short for Free Lossless Audio Codec, is a lossless audio format that compresses audio files without sacrificing quality. It provides a perfect bit-for-bit representation of the original audio.

4. **AAC**: Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a widely used audio format that offers high-quality audio at lower bitrates compared to other formats. It is commonly used for streaming and online distribution.

5. **OGG**: OGG is an open and free audio container format that can store audio, video, and other multimedia data. It uses the Vorbis audio codec for audio compression.

6. **M4A**: M4A is a file extension used for MPEG-4 Audio Layer audio files. It is often associated with Apple iTunes and is supported by most Apple devices and media players.

7. **AIFF**: Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is an uncompressed audio format commonly used in professional audio applications. It is supported by many audio software and hardware systems.

8. **Opus**: Opus is a free and open audio codec designed specifically for online streaming and communication. It provides high-quality audio at a low bitrate and is widely supported by modern devices and web browsers.

It is important to note that the availability of these formats may vary depending on the underlying installation of Pydub, as it relies on external libraries such as FFmpeg and Libav for format support. Therefore, it is recommended to check the Pydub documentation or refer to the underlying libraries' documentation for the specific formats supported by your installation.

By understanding the various audio formats supported by Pydub, you can effectively manipulate and process audio files in your Python projects with ease.
