Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique used to analyze and understand the sentiment behind a piece of text. With the help of Python and its libraries, we can easily build a sentiment analysis dashboard to visualize and monitor the sentiment of user feedback or social media posts.

In this tutorial, we will use **Python Dash**, a Python framework for building analytical web applications, and **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a popular sentiment analysis library.

## Setting up the project

First, let's set up our project by installing the necessary libraries. We need `dash`, `pandas`, and `nltk` for this project.

```python
$ pip install dash pandas nltk
```
```python
import dash
import dash_html_components as html
import dash_core_components as dcc

app = dash.Dash(__name__)
```

## Building the sentiment analysis model

To perform sentiment analysis, we will use the **VADER** library from **nltk**. VADER is a well-known library that can handle sentiment analysis for social media texts.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```

## Creating the Python Dash app

Now that we have set up the necessary libraries and the sentiment analysis model, we can start building our Python Dash app.

```python
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1("Sentiment Analysis Dashboard"),
    dcc.TextArea(
        id='input-text',
        placeholder='Enter text here...',
        style={'width': '100%', 'height': '200px'}
    ),
    html.Button('Analyze', id='analyze-button', n_clicks=0),
    dcc.Graph(id='sentiment-graph')
])
```

## Visualizing the sentiment analysis results

Our app consists of a text area where the user can input their text, a button to trigger the sentiment analysis, and a graph to visualize the sentiment analysis results.

```python
@app.callback(
    dash.dependencies.Output('sentiment-graph', 'figure'),
    [dash.dependencies.Input('analyze-button', 'n_clicks')],
    [dash.dependencies.State('input-text', 'value')]
)
def update_sentiment_graph(n_clicks, value):
    sentiment = sid.polarity_scores(value)['compound']
    colorscale = [[0, 'red'], [0.5, 'yellow'], [1, 'green']]
    
    figure = {
        'data': [
            {'x': ['Sentiment'], 'y': [sentiment], 'type': 'bar', 'marker': {'color': sentiment, 'colorscale': colorscale}}
        ],
        'layout': {
            'title': 'Sentiment Analysis Result',
            'yaxis': {'range': [-1, 1]},
            'height': 350
        }
    }
    
    return figure
```

## Conclusion

With the power of Python Dash and VADER, we have successfully built a sentiment analysis dashboard. This dashboard allows us to input text and visualize the sentiment analysis results in real-time.

By monitoring sentiment, we can gain valuable insights into the opinions and emotions behind user feedback and social media posts. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions and improve user experiences.
