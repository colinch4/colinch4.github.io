## Introduction
Python Dash is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications. It is built on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, making it an excellent choice for creating data-driven dashboards. In this tutorial, we will leverage the capabilities of Dash to monitor network statistics and display them in real-time.

## Setting up the environment
To get started, we need to set up our development environment. We assume that you have Python and pip installed. Follow these steps to install the necessary packages:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv network-monitoring
   source network-monitoring/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install Dash and other required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install dash plotly psutil
   ```

## Creating the Dash application
Now that our environment is set up, let's create our Dash application. Create a new Python file called `app.py` and import the necessary modules:

```python
import dash
import dash_html_components as html
import dash_core_components as dcc
import psutil
import time
```

Next, we will initialize the Dash application:

```python
app = dash.Dash(__name__)
server = app.server
```

## Building the dashboard layout
The next step is to design the layout of our network monitoring dashboard. For simplicity, let's create a simple layout that displays the CPU usage and memory usage in real-time.

```python
app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(children='Network Monitoring Dashboard'),
    html.Div(children=[
        html.H2(children='CPU Usage'),
        dcc.Graph(id='cpu-graph'),
        html.H2(children='Memory Usage'),
        dcc.Graph(id='memory-graph'),
    ]),
    dcc.Interval(id='interval-component', interval=2000),
])
```

## Adding real-time data updates
To make our dashboard update the data in real-time, we will use the `dcc.Interval` component to trigger a callback every few seconds. This callback will update the data for the CPU and memory usage graphs.

```python
@app.callback(
    dash.dependencies.Output('cpu-graph', 'figure'),
    dash.dependencies.Output('memory-graph', 'figure'),
    [dash.dependencies.Input('interval-component', 'n_intervals')]
)
def update_graphs(n):
    cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent()
    memory_usage = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
    
    cpu_fig = {
        'data': [{'type': 'indicator', 'value': cpu_usage, 'title': 'CPU Usage'}],
        'layout': {'title': 'CPU Usage', 'width': 400, 'height': 300}
    }
    
    memory_fig = {
        'data': [{'type': 'indicator', 'value': memory_usage, 'title': 'Memory Usage'}],
        'layout': {'title': 'Memory Usage', 'width': 400, 'height': 300}
    }
    
    return cpu_fig, memory_fig
```

## Conclusion
By leveraging the power of Python Dash, we have created a real-time network monitoring dashboard that displays CPU and memory usage. This is just a basic example, but you can extend this dashboard to include other network statistics and even integrate it with other monitoring tools.

By combining Python's ease of use and Dash's interactivity, you can create robust and visually appealing monitoring dashboards for your network infrastructure. Happy monitoring! #PythonDash #NetworkMonitoring
