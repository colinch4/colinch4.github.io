## Introduction to Dash

Dash is a Python framework for building web applications that allows you to write your application code in Python, while benefiting from the power and flexibility of web technologies. Dash uses Flask, React, and Plotly under the hood, providing a seamless and easy-to-use way to build web applications with Python.

## Creating a basic Dash application

To get started with Dash, you need to install the `dash` package. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
pip install dash
```

Next, let's create a basic Dash application that displays a simple "Hello, Dash!" message:

```python
import dash
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div("Hello, Dash!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

When you run this application and open it in your web browser, you should see the "Hello, Dash!" message displayed.

## Adding multiple pages

To create a multi-page application with Dash, you can define separate layouts for each page and combine them together in your main application.

Let's create a new file called `page1.py` and define a layout for the first page:

```python
import dash_html_components as html

layout = html.Div("This is page 1")
```

Similarly, create another file called `page2.py` and define a layout for the second page:

```python
import dash_html_components as html

layout = html.Div("This is page 2")
```

In your main application file, you can import these layouts and combine them together using the `dcc.Location` and `dcc.Link` components:

```python
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
from page1 import layout as layout_page1
from page2 import layout as layout_page2

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Location(id="url", refresh=False),
    html.Nav([
        dcc.Link("Page 1", href="/page1"),
        dcc.Link("Page 2", href="/page2"),
    ]),
    html.Div(id="content"),
])

@app.callback(Output("content", "children"), [Input("url", "pathname")])
def display_page(pathname):
    if pathname == "/page1":
        return layout_page1
    elif pathname == "/page2":
        return layout_page2
    else:
        return "Page not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

Now, when you run the main application and navigate to "/page1" or "/page2", you should see the respective page content displayed.

## Navigating between pages

To enable navigation between pages, we added `dcc.Location` and `dcc.Link` components to our main application layout. The `dcc.Location` component keeps track of the current URL, and the `dcc.Link` components provide links to each page.

In the `display_page` callback function, we use the `pathname` property of the `dcc.Location` component to determine which page to display. If the path matches "/page1", we return the layout for page 1. If the path matches "/page2", we return the layout for page 2. If the path doesn't match either, we display a "Page not found" message.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to build multi-page applications using the Python Dash framework. Dash provides a powerful and flexible way to create interactive web applications with Python. By defining separate layouts for each page and using the `dcc.Location` and `dcc.Link` components, we can easily navigate between pages and create a seamless user experience.
