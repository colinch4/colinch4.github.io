Object tracking is an essential task in computer vision and has various applications like surveillance, video analysis, and autonomous navigation. One popular algorithm for object tracking is DeepSORT (Deep Learning for Multi-Object Tracking).

DeepSORT combines deep learning-based object detection and appearance matching techniques to track objects across video frames. In this article, we will explore the implementation of DeepSORT in Python.

## Requirements
To get started with DeepSORT, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keras
- Dlib (for face detection)

## Installation
1. First, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official website or use a package manager like Anaconda.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```shell
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy keras dlib
```

3. Download the DeepSORT implementation from the GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort.git
```

## Getting Started
1. After completing the installation, navigate to the `deep_sort` directory.

2. You will find a demo script named `deep_sort_app.py` in the directory. This script uses a pre-trained deep learning model for object detection and DeepSORT algorithm for tracking.

3. To run the demo, execute the following command:

```shell
python deep_sort_app.py
```

This will launch the video streaming with object detection and tracking. By default, it uses the built-in webcam as the video source. If you want to use a different video file, you can modify the code accordingly.

## Object Detection
DeepSORT requires an object detection model to identify objects in each frame. The demo script uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for this purpose. You can find the pre-trained YOLO model in the `resources/detection` directory.

If you want to use a different object detection model, you can modify the code in `deep_sort_app.py` and replace it with your preferred model.

## Object Tracking with DeepSORT
The DeepSORT algorithm uses a combination of appearance matching and Kalman filtering technique for object tracking. It tracks the objects by associating bounding boxes across consecutive frames using their appearance features.

The appearance features are generated from the object detection model. DeepSORT uses a deep convolutional network to extract these features and uses a metric learning algorithm to match the features.

To understand the implementation details of DeepSORT, refer to the `deep_sort` directory where you can find the necessary code files for tracking and associating objects.

## Conclusion
DeepSORT is an effective algorithm for object tracking and can be implemented using Python and popular computer vision libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Keras. By combining object detection and appearance matching techniques, DeepSORT provides robust and accurate tracking capabilities.

In this article, we covered the installation process, usage, and the basic concepts of DeepSORT. By exploring the implementation details and experimenting with different models and parameters, you can further enhance the tracking performance.
