In this blog post, we will explore how to handle pagination in Python Hug API. Pagination is a common technique used to display large datasets in smaller, manageable chunks. It allows users to navigate through the dataset without overwhelming the server or the client.

### What is Pagination?

Pagination refers to dividing a large dataset into smaller "pages" or subsets. Each page contains a limited number of records, making it easier to navigate and process the data incrementally.

### Pagination in Python Hug

Python Hug is a lightweight, modern web framework for building APIs. It simplifies the development process and provides features to handle pagination efficiently.

When designing your API with Hug, it's important to consider how you want to handle pagination. Here's an example of how you can incorporate pagination into your Hug API.

First, let's define a route for fetching data with pagination:

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/data')
def get_data(page: hug.types.number = 1, per_page: hug.types.number = 10):
    # Query the database or retrieve data from any other source
    # based on the page and per_page parameters

    # Calculate the offset based on the page and per_page values
    offset = (page - 1) * per_page

    # Query the data with the calculated offset and per_page values
    data = query_data(offset, per_page)

    # Return the data as a response
    return {'data': data}
```

In the above code, we define a route `/data` that accepts two query parameters `page` and `per_page`. These parameters allow the user to specify the page number and the number of records per page, respectively.

Inside the `get_data` function, we calculate the offset based on the `page` and `per_page` values. This offset determines the starting point from where data should be retrieved. We then call a method `query_data` that performs the actual data retrieval based on the offset and per_page values.

Finally, we return the fetched data as a response.

### Consuming the Paginated API

To consume the above API, clients can make GET requests to the `/data` endpoint with appropriate query parameters. For example:

```
GET /data?page=2&per_page=20
```

This request will retrieve the second page of data with 20 records per page.

Clients can iterate over the pages by increasing the `page` parameter until all the data is fetched. Additionally, they can control the number of records per page using the `per_page` parameter.

### Conclusion

Handling pagination is crucial when dealing with large datasets in API development. Python Hug makes it easy to implement pagination by providing query parameters to define page number and records per page. By following the above approach, you can seamlessly handle pagination in your Python Hug API.
