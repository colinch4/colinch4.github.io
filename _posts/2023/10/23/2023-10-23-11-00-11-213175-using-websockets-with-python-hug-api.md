Websockets are a powerful communication protocol that allow real-time, two-way communication between a client and server. Python Hug API is a lightweight framework that makes it easy to build and deploy APIs. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate websockets into a Python Hug API.

## What are Websockets?

Websockets are a communication protocol that enables bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are stateless and require the client to initiate a connection for every request, websockets provide a persistent connection that allows real-time data transfer.

## Python Hug API

Python Hug API is a modern, lightweight framework for building and deploying APIs. It focuses on simplicity and productivity, allowing developers to quickly create RESTful APIs with minimal boilerplate code. Hug embraces the use of decorators to define API routes and automatically handles request parsing and response formatting.

## Integrating Websockets with Python Hug API

### Installation

To get started, you will need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command to install the `websockets` library:

```python
pip install websockets
```

### Setting up a Websockets Endpoint

First, we need to define a websockets endpoint in our Python Hug API. To do this, we can create a new Python module, such as `websocket_endpoint.py`, and define a function decorated with `hug.websocket_api()`:

```python
import hug
import websockets

@hug.websocket_api('/ws')
class WebsocketEndpoint():
    async def connect(self, websocket):
        pass

    async def disconnect(self, websocket):
        pass

    async def handle_message(self, websocket, message):
        pass
```

In this example, we have defined a websockets endpoint at `/ws`. The `connect()`, `disconnect()`, and `handle_message()` methods are called when a client connects, disconnects, or sends a message, respectively.

### Handling Websockets Connections

Inside the `WebsocketEndpoint` class, we can implement the logic to handle websockets connections. For example, in the `connect()` method, we can perform any necessary setup or validation when a client connects:

```python
async def connect(self, websocket):
    # Perform setup, validation, or authentication logic here
    # Access request information using the `websocket` parameter
    pass
```

Similarly, in the `disconnect()` method, we can handle any cleaning up or bookkeeping tasks when a client disconnects:

```python
async def disconnect(self, websocket):
    # Clean up or perform any necessary tasks when a client disconnects
    pass
```

### Sending and Receiving Messages

To handle incoming messages from clients, we can implement the `handle_message()` method. This method receives the `websocket` object and the received `message` as parameters:

```python
async def handle_message(self, websocket, message):
    # Process the received message and send a response if needed
    await websocket.send('Received: ' + message)
```

Sending messages to connected clients is as simple as using the `websocket.send()` method:

```python
await websocket.send('Hello, client!')
```

## Conclusion

Integrating websockets with Python Hug API allows for real-time, two-way communication between clients and servers. By leveraging the `websockets` library and the simplicity of Python Hug API, developers can easily build powerful and responsive APIs.

In this blog post, we explored how to set up a websockets endpoint in Python Hug API, handle connections and messages from clients, and send and receive messages. With this knowledge, you can now leverage the power of websockets in your Python Hug API projects.
