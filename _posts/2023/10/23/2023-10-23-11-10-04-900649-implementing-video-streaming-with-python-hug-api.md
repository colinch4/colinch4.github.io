With the increasing popularity of video content, implementing video streaming functionality in a web application has become a common requirement. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video streaming using Python Hug API, a lightweight framework for building APIs.

## Understanding Video Streaming

Video streaming is a method of delivering video content over the internet in real-time. It allows users to watch videos without downloading the entire file beforehand. Instead, the video is delivered in small chunks, which are played as they are received. This enables users to start watching the video immediately, without waiting for the entire file to download.

## Setting Up Python Hug API

Before we can start implementing video streaming, we need to set up Python Hug API in our project. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Python if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Hug API using pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   pip install hug
   ```

3. Create a new Python file for your API implementation.

4. Import the necessary modules in your Python file:

   ```python
   import hug
   import os
   ```

With Python Hug API set up, we can now move on to implementing video streaming.

## Implementing Video Streaming

To implement video streaming with Python Hug API, we need to define an API endpoint that will handle the streaming.

```python
@hug.get("/video/{video_name}")
def stream_video(response, video_name: hug.types.text):
    video_path = os.path.join("videos", video_name)
    size = os.path.getsize(video_path)
    
    response.set_header("Content-Length", str(size))
    response.set_header("Content-Type", "video/mp4")
    
    with open(video_path, "rb") as video:
        chunk = video.read(4096)
        while chunk:
            response.write(chunk)
            chunk = video.read(4096)
```

In the code snippet above, we define a `stream_video` endpoint that takes a `video_name` parameter from the URL path. We then construct the path to the video file using the `os.path.join` method.

Next, we retrieve the size of the video file using `os.path.getsize` and set the appropriate response headers using `response.set_header`. The `Content-Length` header specifies the size of the video, and the `Content-Type` header indicates that the content is a video of type MP4.

Finally, we open the video file in binary mode using `open` and iterate over it in chunks of 4096 bytes. We write each chunk to the response stream using `response.write`.

To test the video streaming endpoint, run your Python file and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/video/{video_name}` in your web browser, replacing `{video_name}` with the name of the video file you want to stream.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement video streaming with Python Hug API. We explored the concept of video streaming, set up Python Hug API, and implemented a video streaming endpoint using Python. Now you can incorporate video streaming functionality into your web applications using Python Hug API. Happy streaming!
