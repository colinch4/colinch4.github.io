## Introduction {#introduction}

API documentation plays a crucial role in ensuring that developers can easily understand and utilize your API. Python Hug is a web framework that allows you to rapidly build APIs with minimal boilerplate code. It also provides built-in support for generating and displaying API documentation.

## Setting up the environment {#setting-up-the-environment}

To get started, let's set up our development environment. Make sure you have Python and pip installed. You can create a new virtual environment using the `venv` module:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```python
pip install hug
```

## Defining API routes {#defining-api-routes}

Now that our environment is set up, let's define our API routes. Create a new Python file, for example, `app.py`, and import the necessary modules:

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/')
def hello_world():
    return {'message': 'Hello, world!'}
```

In the above example, we have defined a simple API route that returns a JSON object with a greeting message.

## Adding documentation {#adding-documentation}

To add documentation to our API, we can use the `@hug.documentation` decorator. This decorator allows us to specify various details about our API route, such as its description, parameters, and response format. Let's modify our code to include documentation:

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/')
@hug.documentation(name='Hello World', description='Returns a greeting message')
def hello_world():
    return {'message': 'Hello, world!'}
```

In the modified code, we have added the `@hug.documentation` decorator to our API route and provided additional information about the route.

## Viewing the documentation {#viewing-the-documentation}

Python Hug provides a built-in mechanism to view the generated documentation. We can use the `hug.API` class to create an instance of our API and then run it:

```python
import hug

api = hug.API(__name__)
api.http.server.serve()
```

When you run the above code, you will see output similar to the following:

```
Serving on ('127.0.0.1', 8000)
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see the automatically generated API documentation, including the route we defined and the associated details.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In this blog post, we have learned how to create API documentation using Python Hug API. We explored how to define API routes, add documentation using the `@hug.documentation` decorator, and view the generated documentation. API documentation is crucial for making your API easily accessible and understandable to developers. With Python Hug, you can effortlessly generate and display API documentation, making the process seamless and efficient.
