## Introduction
Python Hug is a lightweight and fast framework used to build APIs. It provides an easy-to-use interface, requiring minimal code for creating HTTP endpoints. Deploying your Hug API to a cloud platform offers advantages such as scalability, high availability, and easy management.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python Hug and its dependencies.
- An account on the cloud platform you wish to deploy to (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).

## Deploying Python Hug API to AWS
To deploy your Python Hug API to AWS, follow these steps:

1. Create an AWS account if you don't already have one.
2. Set up an EC2 instance to host your API.
3. Install Python and the necessary dependencies on the EC2 instance.
4. Copy your Python Hug API code to the EC2 instance.
5. Start your Hug API on the EC2 instance.

## Deploying Python Hug API to Azure
To deploy your Python Hug API to Azure, follow these steps:

1. Create an Azure account if you don't already have one.
2. Set up an Azure App Service to host your API.
3. Create a Python environment in Azure.
4. Publish your Python Hug API code to Azure.
5. Configure the App Service to run the Hug API.
