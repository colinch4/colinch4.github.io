## Installing Python Hug

To get started with Python Hug, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website ([python.org](https://www.python.org/)).

Once you have Python installed, you can install Python Hug using pip, the package installer for Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install hug
```

This command will download and install Python Hug along with its dependencies.

## Creating a Basic API

After installing Python Hug, you're ready to create your first API. Create a new Python file with a `.py` extension, for example, `api.py`.

Import the necessary modules and define a function to handle the API endpoint. Here's an example of a basic API that returns a simple JSON response:

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/hello')
def hello():
    return {'message': 'Hello, world!'}
```

In the above code, we imported the `hug` module and defined a GET endpoint `/hello` that returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, world!".

## Running the API

To run the API, use the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```bash
python api.py
```

This command will start the API server on your local machine. You will see an output similar to:

```bash
 * Running on http://localhost:8000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now, you can access the API by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000/hello`. You should see the JSON response `{"message": "Hello, world!"}` displayed on the page.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Python Hug and created a basic API using it.

## Conclusion

Python Hug API simplifies the process of building and deploying web APIs in Python. With its easy installation and simple syntax, you can quickly get started with creating powerful APIs. Explore the Python Hug documentation ([hugapi.github.io](https://hugapi.github.io/)) for more advanced features and examples.
