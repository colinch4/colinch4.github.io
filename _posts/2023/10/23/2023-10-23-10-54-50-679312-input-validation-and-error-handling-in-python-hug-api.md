In any API application, input validation and error handling play a crucial role in ensuring the security, stability, and integrity of the system. Python Hug API provides useful mechanisms to validate input data and handle errors effectively.

## What is Python Hug API?

Python Hug API is a powerful framework for building APIs in Python. It aims to make building APIs as simple as possible, while still providing flexibility and performance. Hug API provides a declarative syntax that allows developers to define their API endpoints and the expected input and output types.

## Input Validation in Python Hug API

Input validation is an essential step to ensure that the data received by the API is of the expected format and meets the required criteria. Python Hug API offers several methods for input validation:

### 1. Type Annotations

Python Hug API leverages Python's type annotations to define the expected data types for input parameters. By using type annotations, you can ensure that the incoming data matches the expected types, and Hug API will automatically handle the validation for you.

```python
import hug

@hug.get()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

In the above example, the `name` parameter is expected to be a string. If a different type is passed, Hug API will automatically raise a validation error.

### 2. Validators

Hug API provides the `validate` decorator, which allows you to define custom validation functions for input parameters. You can use this decorator to add additional validation logic as per your requirements.

```python
import hug

def validate_email(email):
    if not re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email address")

@hug.get()
def send_email(email: validate_email) -> str:
    # Logic to send email
    return "Email sent successfully"
```

In the above example, the `email` parameter is wrapped with the `validate_email` function. This function performs custom validation to ensure the provided email address is valid. If the validation fails, a `ValueError` is raised.

## Error Handling in Python Hug API

Error handling is another crucial aspect of building robust APIs. Python Hug API provides a convenient way to handle errors using the `exception` decorator.

```python
import hug

@hug.exception()
def handle_errors(exception: Exception, response: hug.Response):
    # Logic to handle the exception
    response.status = 500
    response.data = {'error': 'Internal Server Error'}

@hug.get()
def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
    try:
        result = a / b
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
```

In the above example, the `handle_errors` function is decorated with the `exception` decorator. It will be invoked whenever an exception occurs within the API endpoint. Inside this function, you can define the logic to handle the exception and modify the response accordingly.

## Conclusion

Input validation and error handling are crucial components of any robust API system. Python Hug API provides powerful mechanisms to validate input data and handle errors effectively. By leveraging type annotations, custom validators, and the exception decorator, you can ensure the integrity and stability of your API endpoints.

Remember to always validate input to prevent security vulnerabilities and handle errors gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.
