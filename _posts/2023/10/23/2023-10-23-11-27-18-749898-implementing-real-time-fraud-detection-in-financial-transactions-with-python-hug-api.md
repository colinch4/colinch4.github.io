Fraud detection is crucial in the financial industry to protect customers and businesses from potential risks. With the increasing number of online transactions, it has become even more critical to have a robust fraud detection system in place.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time fraud detection in financial transactions using the Python Hug API. The Hug API is a lightweight framework that simplifies the process of building APIs in Python, making it an excellent choice for developing fraud detection systems.

## Setting up the environment

To get started, ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system. Create a new virtual environment and activate it using the following commands:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv fraud-detection
$ source fraud-detection/bin/activate
```

Next, install the required packages using pip:

```shell
$ pip install hug pandas scikit-learn
```

## Building the fraud detection model

To build our fraud detection model, we will be using the scikit-learn library, which provides various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. We will train the model using a labeled dataset, with fraud transactions marked as 1 and non-fraud transactions marked as 0.

Here's an example code snippet to train the fraud detection model using logistic regression:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')

# Split the dataset into features and labels
X = df.drop('fraud', axis=1)
y = df['fraud']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

In this example, we load the dataset from a CSV file, split it into features (X) and labels (y), and then split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` function. Finally, we initialize and train the logistic regression model.

## Integrating the Python Hug API

Now that we have our fraud detection model ready, let's integrate it with the Python Hug API. The Hug API allows us to expose our machine learning model as a web service, making it accessible for real-time fraud detection.

First, create a new Python script called `api.py` and import the necessary libraries:

```python
import hug
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the fraud detection model
model = LogisticRegression()
```

Next, define a route for our API to receive transaction data and predict whether it's a fraud or not:

```python
@hug.post('/detect_fraud')
def detect_fraud(transaction: pd.DataFrame):
    prediction = model.predict(transaction)
    return {'fraud': bool(prediction)}
```

In this example, we use the `@hug.post` decorator to define a POST route for our API. The `detect_fraud` function takes a `transaction` parameter, which is expected to be a `pd.DataFrame` containing the transaction data. The function then uses our fraud detection model to predict the outcome and returns a JSON response indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Implementing real-time fraud detection

To test our fraud detection API, we can use tools like cURL or Postman to send POST requests with transaction data, as shown below:

```shell
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"transaction": {"amount": 100, "merchant": "ABC Bank"}}' http://localhost:8000/detect_fraud
```

The API will return a JSON response indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Conclusion

By implementing real-time fraud detection in financial transactions using the Python Hug API, we can create a robust system that helps identify potential fraudulent activities. The combination of machine learning models and API development frameworks like Hug enables us to build scalable and efficient fraud detection systems in Python.
