## Introduction

Email communication is essential in many applications, whether it's sending notifications, password reset links, or newsletters. Python provides several libraries to send emails, and one of the popular ones is the `smtplib` library. However, using Python Hug API can simplify the process of sending emails by providing a clean and intuitive interface.

## Installation

To get started, you first need to install Python Hug API and the required email library. You can install them using pip:

```python
pip install hug
pip install emails
```

## Sending Emails

Once you have Python Hug API and the emails library installed, you can start sending emails in your API routes. Here's an example of a simple email sending functionality:

```python
import hug
from emails import Message

@hug.post('/send-email')
def send_email(email, subject, message):
    # Create a new email message
    email_message = Message(
        subject=subject,
        mail_from=('Your Name', 'your-email@example.com'),
        mail_to=[email]
    )

    # Set the email body and send it
    email_message.body = message
    email_message.send()

    return {'message': 'Email sent successfully'}
```

In the example above, we define a `send_email` function as a Hug API endpoint. This function takes in the recipient's email address, subject, and message as parameters. We then create a new email message using the `Message` class from the emails library and set the subject and recipient.

Next, we set the email body by assigning the `message` parameter to the `body` attribute of the email message. Finally, we send the email using the `send()` method, and if successful, we return a JSON response indicating the email was sent successfully.

You can customize the email message further by adding attachments, HTML content, or specifying additional headers. The emails library provides a rich set of features to handle complex email scenarios.

## Conclusion

With Python Hug API and the emails library, sending emails becomes a straightforward task in your API routes. You can easily customize the email message and handle various email scenarios.

Start using Python Hug API to build your own email sending functionality and enhance your applications with seamless email communication.
