In this blog post, we will explore how to implement GraphQL subscriptions in a Pyramid application. GraphQL subscriptions allow clients to receive real-time updates from the server when specific events occur. This is particularly useful for applications that require real-time data synchronization.

## What are GraphQL subscriptions?

GraphQL subscriptions are a way to establish a long-lived connection between the client and the server, enabling real-time data transfer. When a client subscribes to a specific event, the server can push updates to the client whenever that event occurs.

## Setting up the environment

Before diving into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- PyPI package manager (pip) installed
- Pyramid framework installed (`pip install pyramid`)

## Installing required packages

To enable GraphQL subscriptions, we need to install the necessary packages:

```python
pip install graphene-pydantic-websocket graphql-ws pyramid-graphql[subscriptions]
```

## Creating a GraphQL subscription

To create a GraphQL subscription in Pyramid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define the subscription type: In your schema definition, specify the subscription type and the fields that clients can subscribe to. For example, let's consider a chat application where clients can subscribe to new messages:

```python
import graphene

class MessageSubscription(graphene.ObjectType):
    new_message = graphene.Field(MessageType)
```

2. Implement the resolver function: The resolver function handles incoming subscription requests and determines what data to send to the client. In our example, the resolver function for `new_message` might query the database for new messages:

```python
async def resolve_new_message(root, info):
    subscription = SubscriptionService.get_subscription('new_message')
    # Query the database and return the new message
```

3. Configure the subscription endpoint: In your Pyramid configuration, configure the WebSocket view for handling incoming subscription requests:

```python
from pyramid.config import Configurator
from pyramid_graphql_subscriptions import GraphQLSubscriptionView

def includeme(config: Configurator):
    config.include('pyramid_graphql')
    config.add_route('subscriptions', '/subscriptions')
    config.add_view(GraphQLSubscriptionView, route_name='subscriptions')
```

4. Handling subscriptions on the client-side: On the client-side, you can use libraries like Apollo Client to subscribe to events from the server. For example, to subscribe to new messages:

```javascript
const NEW_MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION = gql`
  subscription NewMessageSubscription {
    newMessage {
      id
      content
      createdAt
    }
  }
`;

const subscription = client.subscribe({ query: NEW_MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION });

subscription.subscribe({
    next: (response) => {
        // Handle new message received
    },
    error: (error) => {
        // Handle subscription error
    },
});
```

And that's it! You have successfully implemented GraphQL subscriptions in your Pyramid application. Clients can now receive real-time updates whenever new messages are added.

## Conclusion

GraphQL subscriptions add real-time functionality to your applications, allowing clients to receive updates as soon as specific events occur. In this blog post, we explored how to implement GraphQL subscriptions in a Pyramid application, from defining the subscription type to configuring the subscription endpoint and handling subscriptions on the client-side.

By incorporating GraphQL subscriptions into your application, you can provide a more dynamic and responsive user experience.
