In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement RESTful API versioning in Pyramid, a popular web framework for building web applications in Python. 

## What is API versioning?

API versioning is the practice of versioning your application's API to ensure backward compatibility and provide a smooth transition for clients when making changes to the API. By versioning your API, you can introduce new features, deprecate old ones, and maintain compatibility with existing clients.

## Why use API versioning in Pyramid?

Using API versioning in Pyramid allows you to introduce breaking changes without impacting existing clients. It also enables you to add new features and improvements to your API while ensuring backward compatibility. This helps in maintaining a stable and predictable API that can evolve over time.

## Approaches to API versioning

There are several approaches to implementing API versioning, including:

1. **URL-based versioning**: In this approach, the version number is included in the URL path. For example, `/api/v1/users` for version 1 of the API and `/api/v2/users` for version 2. This approach is simple and easy to implement.

2. **Header-based versioning**: In this approach, the version number is specified in the request header. The API server then handles the request based on the version specified in the header. This approach allows for more flexibility as the version can be changed without modifying the URL.

3. **Media type-based versioning**: In this approach, the version number is included in the media type (e.g., `application/vnd.myapp.v1+json`). This approach allows for easy content negotiation but can be more complex to implement.

## Implementing URL-based versioning in Pyramid

In this example, we will demonstrate how to implement URL-based versioning in Pyramid.

First, let's create separate views for different versions of the API. We will define two versions, v1 and v2.

```python
from pyramid.view import view_config

@view_config(route_name='v1_users', renderer='json')
def v1_users(request):
    # Version 1 logic goes here
    ...

@view_config(route_name='v2_users', renderer='json')
def v2_users(request):
    # Version 2 logic goes here
    ...
```

Next, let's define the routes for each version in the Pyramid configuration.

```python
def main(global_config, **settings):
    config = Configurator(settings=settings)

    config.add_route('v1_users', '/api/v1/users')
    config.add_route('v2_users', '/api/v2/users')

    config.scan()

    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

Now, when a client makes a request to `/api/v1/users`, it will be handled by the `v1_users` view, and similarly, a request to `/api/v2/users` will be handled by the `v2_users` view.

## Conclusion

By implementing RESTful API versioning in Pyramid, you can ensure backward compatibility and smoothly introduce changes to your API over time. In this blog post, we discussed the different approaches to API versioning and demonstrated how to implement URL-based versioning in Pyramid.

Implementing API versioning is essential for managing the evolution of your API and providing a stable and consistent experience for your users. #restfulapi #pyramid
