Pyramid is a powerful web framework for Python that provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of web applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement i18n and l10n in a Pyramid application.

## Understanding Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)

**Internationalization** is the process of designing and developing a software application in a way that it can be easily adapted to different languages and cultures. It involves separating the application's user interface strings from the code, so they can be easily translated into different languages.

**Localization**, on the other hand, is the process of adapting an internationalized application to a specific language or region. It involves translating the user interface strings and also handling other aspects such as date and time formats, number formats, and currency symbols.

## Enabling i18n and l10n in Pyramid

Pyramid provides a package called `pyramid.i18n` that simplifies the process of enabling i18n and l10n in your application. To enable i18n and l10n in Pyramid, follow these steps:

1. Install the `pyramid.i18n` package by running the command: `pip install pyramid.i18n`

2. In the Pyramid configuration phase, add the following lines of code to enable i18n and l10n:

```python
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def main(global_config, **settings):
    config = Configurator(settings=settings)

    config.include('pyramid.i18n')
    config.add_translation_dirs('yourapp:locale')

    # Additional configuration goes here...

    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

The `add_translation_dirs()` function specifies the location of the translation files for your application. In this example, the translation files are expected to be located in the `yourapp/locale` directory.

## Message Extraction and Translation

Once you have enabled i18n in your Pyramid application, you can start marking the strings that need to be translated with the `gettext` function. The `gettext` function is available as a method of the `pyramid.i18n.TranslationStringFactory` class.

Here's an example:

```python
from pyramid.i18n import TranslationStringFactory

_ = TranslationStringFactory('yourapp')

def login(request):
    message = _('Please enter your credentials:')
    # ...
```

To extract the marked strings for translation, you can use the `pyramid.scripts.pscripts.extract_messages` command-line script provided by Pyramid:

```
pcreate -s yourapp yourapp
cd yourapp
python setup.py extract_messages
```

This command will generate a `.pot` file that contains all the extracted strings. Translators can then translate these strings and generate `.po` files for each language.

To translate the marked strings at runtime, you need to configure a translation utility. You can do this by adding the following lines of code to your Pyramid configuration:

```python
from pyramid.i18n import get_localizer

@subscriber(NewRequest)
def add_localizer(event):
    request = event.request
    localizer = get_localizer(request)
    request.localizer = localizer
```

## Pluralization and Date/Time Formatting

In addition to translating strings, you may need to handle pluralization and date/time formatting in your localized application.

For pluralization, you can use the `ngettext` function provided by the `pyramid.i18n.TranslationStringFactory` class. Here's an example:

```python
from pyramid.i18n impor
