## Introduction to Pyramid

Pyramid is a minimalistic web framework that follows the principles of simplicity and modularity. It provides excellent flexibility by allowing developers to choose and combine different components to fit their specific needs. Whether you are building a simple personal website or a complex enterprise application, Pyramid can handle it all.

## Setting up the environment

Before we start creating our Pyramid application, we need to set up our development environment. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify that Python is installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   You should see the Python version printed on the screen.

3. Install the Pyramid framework by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install pyramid
   ```

   This will install the latest version of Pyramid and its dependencies.

## Creating the application

Now that our environment is set up, we can create our Pyramid application. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```
   mkdir pyramid-app
   cd pyramid-app
   ```

2. Initialize a new Pyramid project:

   ```
   pcreate -s starter .
   ```

   This command creates the basic structure and files for a Pyramid application.

## Creating routes and views

Routes define the URL patterns of our application, and views handle the logic for each route. Let's create a simple route and view to get started:

1. Open the `views.py` file in your project directory and add the following code:

   ```python
   from pyramid.view import view_config

   @view_config(route_name='home', renderer='templates/home.pt')
   def home_view(request):
       return {}
   ```

   This code defines a view function called `home_view` that will handle the `/` route and render the `home.pt` template.

2. Open the `__init__.py` file and add the following code to configure the route:

   ```python
   config.add_route('home', '/')
   config.scan('.views')
   ```

   This code sets up a route named `home` for the root URL ("/") and scans the `views` module for view configurations.

## Rendering templates

Templates allow us to separate the presentation logic from the application logic. Let's create a simple template for our home page:

1. Create a new directory called `templates` in your project directory:

   ```
   mkdir templates
   ```

2. Inside the `templates` directory, create a new file called `home.pt` and add the following HTML code:

   ```html
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My Pyramid Application</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My Pyramid Application!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This is a basic HTML template for our home page.

## Running the application

Now that our application is set up, we can run it to see it in action:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the Pyramid development server:

   ```
   pserve development.ini --reload
   ```

   This command will start the server and reload it whenever you make changes to your code.

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:6543` to see your Pyramid application running.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a basic Pyramid application. We learned how to set up the environment, create routes and views, render templates, and run the application. Pyramid's flexibility and ease of use make it a great choice for building web applications. With its extensive documentation and active community, there is no limit to what you can achieve with Pyramid.
