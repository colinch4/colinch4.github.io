In software development, it is important to separate the data access logic from the business logic. The **Data Mapper pattern** is a design pattern that helps in achieving this separation. It provides a layer of abstraction between the application and the data source, allowing for easier manipulation and management of data.

## What is the Data Mapper Pattern?

The Data Mapper pattern is a type of **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** pattern that provides a mapping between the domain objects and the underlying data storage. It decouples the domain objects (or entities) from the data source, allowing them to be manipulated independently of the specific persistence framework or database.

The main idea behind the Data Mapper pattern is to have a separate mapper class for each domain object that handles all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to that object. The mapper class is responsible for querying the data source, transforming the returned data into domain objects, and persisting changes back to the data source.

## Implementing the Data Mapper Pattern in Python

Let's see how we can implement the Data Mapper pattern in Python using a simple example. Suppose we have a `User` class representing a user in our system. We want to store and retrieve user data from a relational database.

First, we define our `User` class:

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, id, username, email):
        self.id = id
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
```

Next, we create a `UserMapper` class responsible for handling the data access operations:

```python
class UserMapper:
    def save(self, user):
        # Save the user's data to the database
        # Implementation details may vary depending on the database or ORM used
        
    def find_by_id(self, user_id):
        # Retrieve user data from the database
        # Create a User object and return it

    def find_by_username(self, username):
        # Retrieve user data from the database
        # Create a User object and return it

    def update(self, user):
        # Update the user's data in the database

    def delete(self, user):
        # Delete the user's data from the database
```

To use the `UserMapper`, we can simply create an instance and invoke the appropriate methods:

```python
user_mapper = UserMapper()

# Create a new user
new_user = User(id=1, username="john_doe", email="john.doe@example.com")
user_mapper.save(new_user)

# Find a user by ID
found_user = user_mapper.find_by_id(1)

# Update the user's email
found_user.email = "new_email@example.com"
user_mapper.update(found_user)

# Delete the user
user_mapper.delete(found_user)
```

## Benefits of the Data Mapper Pattern

The Data Mapper pattern provides several benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The pattern separates the database logic from the domain logic, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. **Flexibility**: The Data Mapper pattern allows for interchangeable data sources without affecting the application's domain logic.
3. **Testability**: With the Data Mapper pattern, the domain objects can be easily tested without connections to the actual database.
4. **Security**: By separating the data access logic, it becomes easier to apply security measures such as input validation and parameterized queries.

By implementing the Data Mapper pattern, developers can achieve a clear separation of concerns, enabling easier maintenance, extensibility, and testability of the application.
