In software development, the Layered Pattern is a common architectural pattern used to organize and structure the codebase of an application. It promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase modular and easier to maintain and evolve. In this article, we will explore the Layered Pattern and how to implement it in Python.

## Introduction to Layered Pattern

The Layered Pattern divides an application into separate layers, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. Each layer interacts with the adjacent layer, following strict guidelines.

The layers are organized hierarchically, with higher layers depending on lower layers. The most common layers in the Layered Pattern are:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interaction and displays information to the user.
2. **Application Layer**: Contains the business logic and coordinates the flow of data between different layers.
3. **Domain Layer**: Defines the core business logic and encapsulates domain-specific rules and entities.
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides access to external resources or services, such as databases or APIs.

## Benefits of Layered Pattern

The Layered Pattern offers several benefits:

- **Modularity**: Each layer is responsible for a specific set of functionalities, allowing for easier maintenance and code evolution.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer focuses on a specific aspect of the application, making the codebase more manageable and understandable.
- **Testability**: The separation between layers makes it easier to write unit tests and integration tests for each layer independently.
- **Scalability**: As the application grows, new layers can be added and existing layers can be adapted without impacting the entire codebase.

## Layers in Layered Pattern

Let's dive deeper into the layers typically found in a Layered Pattern:

### Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer handles the user interface and user interaction. It could be a web interface, command-line interface, or any other form of user interface. It receives user input and displays information to the user. Examples of components in this layer include controllers, views, and UI elements.

### Application Layer

The Application Layer contains the business logic of the application. It coordinates the flow of data between the Presentation Layer and the Domain Layer. This layer is responsible for processing user input, invoking appropriate actions, and orchestrating the interactions between various components. It often contains service classes or use case classes.

### Domain Layer

The Domain Layer encapsulates the core business logic and defines the entities and rules specific to the application's domain. It focuses on the essential concepts and behaviors of the application. This layer is independent of any external dependencies and can be reused in different applications or contexts.

### Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer provides access to external resources or services required by the application, such as databases, APIs, or file systems. It handles the storage and retrieval of data and provides necessary abstractions to interact with external systems. Examples of components in this layer include repositories, data access objects (DAOs), network clients, or cache systems.

## Implementing the Layered Pattern in Python

To implement the Layered Pattern in Python, you can create separate directories or modules for each layer. Each layer should be responsible for its respective functionalities and interact with adjacent layers following defined rules and interfaces.

Here's an example directory structure for implementing the Layered Pattern in Python:

```
├── presentation
│   ├── controllers.py
│   └── views.py
├── application
│   ├── services.py
│   └── use_cases.py
├── domain
│   ├── entities.py
│   └── repositories.py
└── infrastructure
    ├── databases.py
    ├── api_clients.py
    └── cache_systems.py
```

In this example, each layer has its own module or directory, containing the relevant components specific to that layer.

## Conclusion

The Layered Pattern is a powerful architectural pattern that promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and scalability in software applications. By structuring the codebase into layers, you can create a well-organized and maintainable system.

In this article, we explored the concept of the Layered Pattern, the benefits it offers, and how to implement it in Python. By following this pattern, you can build robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.
