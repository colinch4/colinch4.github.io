## What are regular expressions?

Regular expressions are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. They are useful for finding and manipulating text based on certain criteria. For example, you can use regular expressions to search for email addresses, phone numbers, URLs, or any other pattern you define.

## Syntax and basic concepts

To use regular expressions, you need to understand the syntax and basic concepts. Here are a few key elements:

1. **Literals** - These are characters that match exactly as they appear. For example, the regular expression `cat` would match the string "cat".

2. **Character classes** - These define a set of characters to match. For example, the character class `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.

3. **Quantifiers** - These specify how many times a character or group should occur. For example, `a{3}` matches exactly three consecutive "a" characters.

4. **Anchors** - These are used to specify the position of a match within a string. The anchor `^` matches the beginning of the string, while `$` matches the end.

5. **Modifiers** - These are used to perform case-insensitive or global matches. For example, the `i` modifier makes the search case-insensitive.

## Using regular expressions in code

Different programming languages have built-in support for regular expressions. Here's an example using Python:

```python
import re

# Define the pattern
pattern = r'\d+'  # Matches one or more digits

# Search for matches
text = 'I have 25 apples and 10 oranges'
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

# Print the matches
print(matches)  # Output: ['25', '10']
```

In the code above, we import the `re` module, which provides functions for working with regular expressions. We define a pattern `r'\d+'` that matches one or more digits. We then use the `re.findall()` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text.

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are incredibly useful for extracting specific patterns from text. They allow you to search, match, and manipulate strings based on a defined pattern. By mastering regular expressions, you have a powerful tool at your disposal for working with textual data.
