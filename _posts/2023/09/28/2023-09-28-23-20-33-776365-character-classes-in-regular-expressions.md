In regular expressions, character classes are enclosed in square brackets `[]` and can be used to match any single character from the specified set of characters.

Here are some common examples of character classes:

1. Match any digit: `[0-9]`
   This character class will match any single digit from 0 to 9. For example, the regular expression `/[0-9]/` would match any string that contains a single digit.

2. Match any lowercase letter: `[a-z]`
   This character class will match any single lowercase letter from a to z. For example, the regular expression `/[a-z]/` would match any string that contains a single lowercase letter.

3. Match any uppercase letter: `[A-Z]`
   This character class will match any single uppercase letter from A to Z. For example, the regular expression `/[A-Z]/` would match any string that contains a single uppercase letter.

4. Match any alphanumeric character: `[a-zA-Z0-9]`
   This character class will match any single alphanumeric character. For example, the regular expression `/[a-zA-Z0-9]/` would match any string that contains a single alphanumeric character.

5. Match any whitespace character: `[\s]`
   This character class will match any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks. For example, the regular expression `/[\s]/` would match any string that contains a single whitespace character.

It's important to note that character classes can also be negated by including a `^` character at the beginning of the square brackets. For example, `[^0-9]` would match any character that is not a digit.

In conclusion, character classes in regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to match against specific sets of characters. By using character classes, we can define patterns that match digits, letters, alphanumeric characters, or even whitespace characters with ease. Using character classes can greatly enhance the power and versatility of regular expressions in your programming tasks.
