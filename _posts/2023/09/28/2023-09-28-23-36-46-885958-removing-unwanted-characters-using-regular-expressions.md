## Removing unwanted characters using regular expressions in Python

Python has a built-in module called `re` that provides support for regular expressions. To remove unwanted characters from a string, you can use the `re.sub()` function. Let's consider an example where we want to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string:

```python
import re

def remove_unwanted_chars(input_string):
    return re.sub(r'\W+', '', input_string)
```

In the above code, `re.sub()` is used to replace all non-alphanumeric characters (represented by the `\W+` regular expression pattern) with an empty string. Here's an example usage:

```python
input_string = "Hello! How are you?"
cleaned_string = remove_unwanted_chars(input_string)
print(cleaned_string)  # Output: HelloHowareyou
```

## Removing unwanted characters using regular expressions in JavaScript

JavaScript also supports regular expressions via the `RegExp` object. We can use the `replace()` method to remove unwanted characters from a string. Let's remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string using JavaScript:

```javascript
function removeUnwantedChars(inputString) {
  return inputString.replace(/\W+/g, '');
}
```

In the JavaScript code snippet, we use the `replace()` method with the regular expression `\W+` to replace all non-alphanumeric characters globally (`g`) with an empty string. Here's an example usage:

```javascript
let inputString = "Hello! How are you?";
let cleanedString = removeUnwantedChars(inputString);
console.log(cleanedString);  // Output: HelloHowareyou
```

## Conclusion

Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to remove unwanted characters from strings. Whether you are working in Python or JavaScript (or any other language that supports regular expressions), you can utilize the appropriate methods and functions to achieve the desired result. Remember to consider the specific regular expression syntax and options available in your programming language of choice when applying this technique.
