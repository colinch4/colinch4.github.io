In most programming languages, you can use the \d metacharacter to match any digit. For example, the regular expression \d+ will match one or more consecutive digits.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
import re

string = "The price of the product is $199.99"
pattern = r"\d+"

matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
print(matches)  # Output: ['199', '99']
```

In this example, the \d+ pattern matches one or more consecutive digits. The `re.findall()` function returns all matches found in the string.

If you want to match specific sequences of digits, you can use additional metacharacters. For example, to match exactly three consecutive digits, you can use the pattern \d{3}. To match a specific range of digits, you can use \d{2,4} to match two to four consecutive digits.

```python
import re

string = "My phone number is 123-4567"
pattern = r"\d{3}-\d{4}"

matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
print(matches)  # Output: ['123-4567']
```

In this example, the pattern \d{3}-\d{4} matches a sequence of three digits followed by a hyphen and then four digits.

Regular expressions provide a flexible and efficient way to match and extract digit sequences from strings. By using different metacharacters and patterns, you can customize the matching behavior to suit your needs.
