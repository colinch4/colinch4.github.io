1. `.` (Dot): The dot meta character matches any character except a newline character. It can be used to represent any single character in a pattern.

Example: 
```python
import re

pattern = "a.b" # Matches any string with 'a', any character, and then 'b'
text = "acb, abb, aab, axb"

result = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(result) 
# Output: ['acb', 'abb', 'aab', 'axb']
```

2. `^` (Caret): The caret meta character represents the beginning of a line. When used outside of a character set (square brackets), it indicates that the pattern must start at the beginning.

Example:
```python
import re

pattern = "^Hello" # Matches strings starting with 'Hello'
text = "Hello World, Hello there"

result = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(result) 
# Output: ['Hello']
```

3. `$` (Dollar): The dollar meta character represents the end of a line. It denotes that the pattern must end at the specified position.

Example:
```python
import re

pattern = "World$" # Matches 'World' at the end of the line
text = "Hello World, World"

result = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(result) 
# Output: ['World']
```

4. `*` (Asterisk): The asterisk meta character denotes zero or more occurrences of the preceding element. It matches the preceding character, character class, or group zero or more times.

Example:
```python
import re

pattern = "go*l" # Matches 'gol', 'gool', 'goooool', etc.
text = "goal, gogl, gool, gooooool"

result = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(result) 
# Output: ['goal', 'gogl', 'gool', 'goooool']
```

These are just a few examples of meta characters in regular expressions. Mastering regex meta characters is key to harnessing the full power of regular expressions in pattern matching and text manipulation. Remember to escape meta characters when you want to match them literally by using a backslash `\`.
