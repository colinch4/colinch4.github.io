One of the key features of regular expressions is the ability to use groups and capturing. Groups allow us to group parts of a pattern together, while capturing allows us to extract those groups for further use. Let's take a closer look at how groups and capturing work in regular expressions.

### Groups
Groups in regular expressions are defined using parentheses `()`. They allow us to group multiple elements together as a single unit. This is useful when we want to apply modifiers or quantifiers to a specific group of characters.

For example, consider the regular expression `(ab)+`. In this pattern, the group `(ab)` matches the sequence of characters "ab". The `+` quantifier specifies that the group should occur one or more times. This means the pattern will match strings like "ab", "abab", "ababab", and so on.

### Capturing
Capturing in regular expressions allows us to extract the matched groups for further use. When we define a group using parentheses, the content of that group can be captured and referenced later in our code.

To capture a group, we can use a backreference, which is a reference to a captured group. Backreferences are represented by a backslash followed by a number, starting from 1. The number corresponds to the order of the capturing group in the regex pattern.

For example, if we have the regex pattern `(ab)+` and we want to capture the repeated occurrences of "ab", we can use the backreference `\1` in our code to refer to those captured groups.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
import re

pattern = r'(ab)+'
text = 'ababab'

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

for match in matches:
    print(f"Captured group: {match}")
```

In this example, the `findall()` function from the `re` module is used to find all matches of the pattern in the given text. The matched groups are stored in the `matches` list. We then iterate over the matches and print each captured group.

Output:
```
Captured group: ab
```

In this case, the captured group is "ab", which is the repeated sequence that matched the pattern `(ab)+`.

Groups and capturing are powerful features of regular expressions that allow us to define complex patterns and extract meaningful information from text. They are widely used in various programming languages and can be a valuable tool in text processing and manipulation tasks.
