One commonly used metacharacter in regular expressions is the dot (.), also known as the wildcard character. In regex, the dot acts as a placeholder that matches any single character except for a newline.

For example, consider the regular expression pattern "c.t". This pattern will match any string that starts with the letter 'c', followed by any character, and ends with the letter 't'. It will match strings such as "cat", "cut", or "cot".

Here is an example of how the dot metacharacter is used in Python:

```python
import re

pattern = r"c.t"
text = "The cat sat on the mat."

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['cat', 'cat']
```

In the example above, we use the `re.findall()` function from the `re` module in Python to find all occurrences of the pattern "c.t" in the given text. It will return a list of all matched strings.

It's important to note that the dot metacharacter matches any single character, including numbers, letters, symbols, and whitespace. If you want to match a specific dot character (.), you need to escape it using a backslash (\.).

To summarize, the dot (.) metacharacter in regular expressions is a powerful tool that matches any single character (except for a newline). It allows for flexible and dynamic pattern matching within strings, making regular expressions an invaluable tool for text processing and data extraction.
