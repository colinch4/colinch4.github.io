To match case-insensitive patterns with regular expressions, we can use the `i` flag. This flag tells the regular expression engine to ignore the case of the characters when searching for a match. Let's look at an example using JavaScript:

```javascript
const string = "Hello, World!";
const pattern = /hello/i;

console.log(pattern.test(string)); // Output: true
```

In the above example, we create a regular expression `pattern` with the `/hello/i` syntax. The `i` flag makes the pattern case-insensitive. When we call the `test()` method of the regular expression on our `string`, it returns `true` because the pattern `hello` is found, irrespective of the case.

To match case-insensitive patterns with other programming languages, the syntax may vary slightly, but the concept remains the same. For instance, in Python, we can achieve this using the `re` module:

```python
import re

string = "Hello, World!"
pattern = re.compile(r"hello", re.IGNORECASE)

print(pattern.search(string))  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'>
```

In this Python example, we use the `re.IGNORECASE` flag with the `re.compile()` function to create a pattern that is case-insensitive. We then use the `search()` method of the pattern to find a match in the string.

By using the appropriate flag, we can easily match case-insensitive patterns in regular expressions across different programming languages. This is especially helpful when dealing with user input or when we want to be flexible in matching patterns with varying cases.
