## Introduction to Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It can be used to find specific sequences of characters, such as words or phrases, within a larger text. Regular expressions are supported by many programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java.

## Matching Multiple Words with Regex

To match multiple words using regular expressions, you can use the "pipe" character (`|`) to specify multiple options. This acts as an OR operator, allowing you to match any of the specified words.

Let's assume we have a string `text` that contains the following sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

### Python Example

```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
pattern = r"quick|jumps"  # Matches either "quick" or "jumps"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['quick', 'jumps']
```

In this example, we use the `re.findall()` function from the `re` module in Python to find all occurrences of the words "quick" or "jumps" in the `text` string. The resulting matches are stored in the `matches` list, which is then printed.

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
const pattern = /quick|jumps/g; // Matches either "quick" or "jumps"

const matches = text.match(pattern);
console.log(matches); // Output: ['quick', 'jumps']
```

In this JavaScript example, we use the `match()` method on the `text` string with the regular expression pattern. The `g` flag is added to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string. The resulting matches are stored in the `matches` array and then logged to the console.

## Conclusion

Regular expressions provide a powerful way to match multiple words or phrases within a string. By using the "pipe" character (`|`) to specify multiple options, you can create flexible patterns for matching. This can be handy in various scenarios, such as searching for specific keywords in text or validating user input. Incorporating regular expressions in your programming toolkit can greatly enhance your ability to manipulate and analyze text data.
