Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and can be used to extract information from HTML code. In this blog post, we will look at how to use regular expressions to match HTML tags.

## Why Use Regular Expressions?

HTML tags are defined by opening (`<tag>`) and closing (`</tag>`) pairs. By using regular expressions, we can easily identify and extract these tags from a given HTML code.

## The Regular Expression Pattern

To match HTML tags, we can use the following regular expression pattern:

```javascript
/<(\w+)\b[^>]*>(.*?)<\/\1>/
```

Let's break down the pattern:

- `<(\w+)` matches the opening tag and captures the tag name.
- `\b[^>]*` matches any attributes present within the opening tag.
- `>(.*?)` matches the content inside the tag and captures it.
- `<\/\1>` matches the closing tag using a backreference to the captured tag name.

## Example Code

Here's an example code snippet in JavaScript that demonstrates how to match HTML tags using regular expressions:

```javascript
const htmlCode = '<div class="container">Hello, <em>world</em>!</div>';
const regex = /<(\w+)\b[^>]*>(.*?)<\/\1>/g;

let match;
while ((match = regex.exec(htmlCode)) !== null) {
  const tagName = match[1];
  const content = match[2];

  console.log(`Found match: <${tagName}> - ${content}`);
}
```

In this example, we have a simple HTML snippet containing a `<div>` tag with a nested `<em>` tag. The regular expression is used to find and extract both tags along with their contents.

## Conclusion

Regular expressions can be a handy tool for matching HTML tags in a given HTML code. With the pattern mentioned above, you can easily extract tag names and their corresponding content. Remember to use regular expressions with caution and handle edge cases appropriately.
