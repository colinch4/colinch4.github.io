To match specific words using regular expressions, you can use the `\b` metacharacter, which represents a word boundary. This ensures that the pattern you define only matches complete words, rather than parts of larger words.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

# Define the word to search for
word_to_match = "fox"

# Create the regular expression pattern
pattern = r"\b" + re.escape(word_to_match) + r"\b"

# Search for the word using the pattern
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

# Print the matches
print(matches)  # Output: ['fox']
```

In this example, we first import the `re` module to use regular expressions. We then define our target text and the word we want to match (`fox` in this case). We create the pattern by concatenating the word with the `\b` metacharacters, which ensure that the match is a standalone word. We use `re.escape()` to escape any characters in the word that have special meaning in regular expressions.

Finally, we use `re.findall()` to find all matches of the pattern in the text, and print the result. In this case, the output is `['fox']`, as it only matches the complete word "fox" in the given text.

By using regular expressions and the word boundary metacharacter, you can easily match and extract specific words from a text, allowing for more efficient and accurate text processing. #RegularExpressions #WordMatching
