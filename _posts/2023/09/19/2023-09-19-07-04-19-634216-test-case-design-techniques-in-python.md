When developing software, it is crucial to thoroughly test it to ensure that it functions as intended and to catch any bugs or issues. To effectively test your Python code, you can make use of various test case design techniques. These techniques help you create a comprehensive set of tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## 1. Equivalence Partitioning

**Equivalence partitioning** is a technique that divides the input domain of a function into partitions, where each partition is expected to behave in a similar way. This technique ensures that you test representative values from each partition, rather than exhaustively testing every possible input.

For example, if you have a function that takes an integer as input, you can partition the input domain into positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. By selecting test cases from each partition, you can cover a wide range of scenarios and increase the chances of catching bugs.

## 2. Boundary Value Analysis

**Boundary value analysis** focuses on selecting test cases that lie on the boundaries of input domains or partitions. This technique recognizes that boundary values often lead to unique behaviors and uncover potential issues.

For instance, if your function accepts an input within a certain range, such as 1 to 10, you would select test cases at the lower and upper bounds (1 and 10), as well as just beyond the bounds (0 and 11). By testing these boundary values, you can reveal any inconsistencies or errors that may occur due to special conditions at the edges.

Here's an example of how you can implement these techniques in Python using the `unittest` module:

```python
import unittest

def calculate_discount(price):
    if price < 0:
        return "Invalid price"
    elif price < 100:
        return price * 0.1
    else:
        return price * 0.2

class DiscountTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_equivalence_partitioning(self):
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(-10), "Invalid price")
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(50), 5)
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(150), 30)

    def test_boundary_value_analysis(self):
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(1), 0.1)
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(99), 9.9)
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(100), 20)
        self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(101), 20.2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In the example above, we have a function `calculate_discount` that calculates the discount based on the price provided. We then define test cases using both equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis techniques. By running the test suite, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

By leveraging these test case design techniques, you can effectively validate your Python code and increase the reliability and quality of your software. Remember to select representative values from different partitions and test boundary conditions to catch any potential bugs or edge case issues.
