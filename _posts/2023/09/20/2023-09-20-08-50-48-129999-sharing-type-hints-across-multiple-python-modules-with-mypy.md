When working on large Python projects, it is common to have multiple modules that depend on each other. Ensuring consistent and correct type annotations across these modules can be a challenge. [MyPy](https://mypy-lang.org/) is a static type checker for Python that helps detect errors and enforce type checking during the development process. In this article, we will explore how to share type hints across multiple modules using MyPy.

## 1. Organizing Type Hints

One approach to sharing type hints is to define them in a separate module and import them as needed. Let's assume we have a project structure with two modules: `main.py` and `utils.py`. In the `utils` module, we can define type aliases, custom types, and any other shared type hints like this:

```python
# utils.py
from typing import List, Tuple

Coordinates = Tuple[float, float]
Matrix = List[List[int]]
```

In `main.py`, we can then import these type hints and use them in our code:

```python
# main.py
from utils import Coordinates, Matrix

def get_coordinates(matrix: Matrix) -> List[Coordinates]:
    result = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            result.append((i, j))
    return result
```

This approach allows us to keep our type hints organized in a dedicated module and easily import them into other modules as needed.

## 2. Exporting Type Hints

MyPy provides a special syntax to export type hints from a module without importing anything. This can be useful when we want certain type hints to be available project-wide without the need to import them explicitly.

To export type hints, we use the `reveal_type` function from MyPy and add type annotations as comments:

```python
# utils.py
from typing import List, Tuple

Coordinates = Tuple[float, float]
Matrix = List[List[int]]

reveal_type(Coordinates)  # type: ignore[export]
reveal_type(Matrix)  # type: ignore[export]
```

Now, when we run MyPy on our project, it will detect the type hints defined with `reveal_type` and make them available for other modules without the need to import anything explicitly.

## 3. Using Configuration Files

MyPy allows us to specify configuration files to control the behavior of the type checker. With a configuration file, we can specify global settings, include/exclude specific modules, and define type hints for modules automatically.

To use a configuration file, create a `mypy.ini` file in the root of your project directory with the following content:

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = reveal_type.plugin

[mypy-utils]
plugins = reveal_type.plugin
```

In this example, we specify that the `reveal_type` plugin should be enabled for all modules (`[mypy]`) and specifically for the `utils` module (`[mypy-utils]`). 

Now, we can remove `reveal_type` calls from our `utils` module since the plugin will automatically export the type hints.

## Conclusion

By using separate modules to organize and share type hints and leveraging the capabilities of MyPy, we can ensure consistent and correct type annotations across our Python projects. Whether it's importing type hints or exporting them project-wide, MyPy provides powerful features to streamline and enforce type checking during development.
