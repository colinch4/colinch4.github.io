In Python, type hints have become increasingly important for improving code readability, maintainability, and catching potential errors at compile time. MyPy is a powerful static type checker for Python that allows developers to add type annotations to their code and catch type-related issues early on.

One useful feature of MyPy is the ability to define custom type aliases, also known as type aliases or type synonyms. These aliases allow you to give a more descriptive name to a complex type or a combination of multiple types. This helps make your code more expressive and easier to understand.

To define a custom type alias in Python, you can use the `typing` module provided by MyPy. Let's look at a simple example:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Define a custom type alias for a coordinate
Coordinate = Tuple[float, float]

# Define a function that takes a list of coordinates
def process_coordinates(coordinates: List[Coordinate]) -> None:
    for coord in coordinates:
        # Process each coordinate

# Create a list of coordinates
my_coordinates = [(1.0, 2.0), (3.0, 4.0), (5.0, 6.0)]

# Call the function with the list of coordinates
process_coordinates(my_coordinates)
```

In this example, we define a custom type alias called `Coordinate` using the `Tuple` type from the `typing` module. This alias represents a tuple with two floating-point numbers, representing x and y coordinates.

We then use this custom type alias to annotate the `coordinates` parameter of the `process_coordinates` function. This provides clarity on the expected input type.

By using type aliases, we make the code more readable and self-explanatory. If we were to change the underlying type of the coordinate, we would only need to update the alias definition in one place, ensuring consistency throughout the codebase.

Using MyPy, we can now run static type checks on this code and catch any potential type errors before they happen at runtime.

In conclusion, defining custom type aliases with MyPy in Python is a great way to improve code clarity, maintainability, and catch potential errors early on. By using type aliases, we can make our code more expressive and easier to understand.
