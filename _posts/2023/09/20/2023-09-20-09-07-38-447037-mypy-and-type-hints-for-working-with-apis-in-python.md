In recent years, the use of static type checkers has gained popularity in the Python community. Among them, **MyPy** has emerged as a powerful tool for type checking and type hinting in Python programs. In this blog post, we will focus on how to use MyPy and type hints specifically when working with APIs in Python.

### What are Type Hints and Why Use Them?

Type hints are a way of adding static typing information to the variables, function parameters, and return types in Python code. By annotating our code with type hints, we can express the expected types of values and enable static type checking tools like MyPy to catch potential type errors, providing better code quality and maintainability.

### Setting Up MyPy

To get started with MyPy, we first need to install it. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install mypy
```

Once installed, we can begin adding type hints to our code.

### Type Hints for API Requests

When working with APIs, it's important to clearly define the structure and types of the data being sent and received. Let's take a look at an example where we make a GET request to an API endpoint that returns a list of users:

```python
import requests
from typing import List, Dict

def get_users() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")
    return response.json()
```

In the above example, we import the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and the `typing` module to define type hints. We define a function called `get_users` which returns a list of dictionaries representing users.

The type hint `List[Dict[str, str]]` indicates that the return value of the `get_users` function is a list where each element is a dictionary with string keys and string values.

### Type Checking with MyPy

With the type hints in place, we can now use MyPy to check our code for any potential type errors. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
mypy your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the actual name of your Python script. MyPy will analyze your code against the defined type hints and display any type errors or warnings.

### Handling API Response

When working with API responses, it's common to handle different response statuses. We can use the `Optional` type hint to indicate that a value is either of a specific type or `None`. Let's modify our previous example to handle an unsuccessful API response:

```python
import requests
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def get_users() -> Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]]:
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None
```

In this modified version, we import the `Optional` type hint from the `typing` module. By specifying `Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]]` as the return type, we indicate that the function may either return a list of user dictionaries or `None` if the API request fails.

### Conclusion

By incorporating MyPy and type hints into our Python codebase, we can improve code quality, catch potential errors, and enhance the overall maintainability of our code. When working with APIs, using type hints can help us better understand the structure of the data being sent and received, making our code more robust and easier to work with.
