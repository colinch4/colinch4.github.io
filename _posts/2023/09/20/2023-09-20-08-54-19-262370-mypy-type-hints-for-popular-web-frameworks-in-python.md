Python is a popular programming language for web development due to its simplicity and readability. One of the challenges of working with large codebases in Python is ensuring code correctness and avoiding potential bugs. That's where type hinting comes in handy. By using the MyPy static type checker, we can enforce type annotations in our code, improving code quality and maintainability.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use MyPy type hints for some of the most popular web frameworks in Python.

## Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. To use MyPy type hints with Django, we can start by installing the necessary packages:

```python
pip install mypy django-stubs
```

Next, we can create a `mypy.ini` file in our Django project's root directory and add the following configuration:

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = django-stubs
```

Now, we can annotate our Django code with types, and MyPy will check for any type errors. Here's an example:

```python
from django.http import HttpRequest, HttpResponse

def hello(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    name: str = request.GET.get("name", "World")
    return HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

By using type hints, MyPy will warn us if we try to access an attribute that doesn't exist on the `HttpRequest` object or if we pass an invalid type to `HttpResponse`.

## Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight web framework for Python with a focus on simplicity and extensibility. To use MyPy type hints with Flask, we need to install the necessary packages:

```python
pip install mypy flask-mypy
```

Similar to Django, we can create a `mypy.ini` file in our Flask project's root directory and add the following configuration:

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = pydantic.mypy
```

Now, we can annotate our Flask code with types, and MyPy will perform static type checking. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello() -> str:
    name: str = request.args.get("name", "World")
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

By using type hints, MyPy will help us identify potential issues like passing an incorrect argument to `request.args.get` or trying to return a value of a different type than specified.

## Conclusion

Adding MyPy type hints to your Python web frameworks can greatly improve code quality and catch potential bugs early in the development process. Whether you are working with Django or Flask, using type annotations with MyPy will give you confidence in your codebase.
