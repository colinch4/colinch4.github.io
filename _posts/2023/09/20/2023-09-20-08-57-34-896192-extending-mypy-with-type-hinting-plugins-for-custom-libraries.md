## Introduction

Type hinting has become an essential part of modern Python development. It helps improve code quality, detect errors early, and enhance code documentation. MyPy, a static type checker for Python, is widely used to validate type hints and catch type-related issues before runtime.

While MyPy provides support for standard Python libraries out of the box, there might be cases where you need to add type hinting support for your own custom libraries or third-party packages that are not officially supported. In this blog post, we will explore how to extend MyPy with type hinting plugins for custom libraries.

## Writing a Type Hinting Plugin

To add type hinting support for a custom library, you need to write a type hinting plugin specifically tailored to that library. Writing a type hinting plugin involves defining a set of rules used by MyPy to infer and validate the types used in that library.

Here is an example of how to write a basic type hinting plugin for a custom library named "my_library":

```python
from my_library import MyCustomClass
from mypy.nodes import TypeInfo
from mypy.plugin import Plugin
from mypy.plugins import FunctionContext
from mypy.types import Type, AnyType

class MyLibraryPlugin(Plugin):

    def get_function_hook(self, fullname: str) -> Optional[Callable[[FunctionContext], Type]]:
        if fullname == 'my_library.my_function':
            return self.handle_my_function
        return None
    
    def handle_my_function(self, ctx: FunctionContext) -> Type:
        # Add type hinting logic here
        return AnyType(TypeInfo())

def plugin(version: str) -> Type[Plugin]:
    return MyLibraryPlugin
```

In this example, we define a class `MyLibraryPlugin` that extends the `Plugin` class provided by MyPy. The `get_function_hook` method is used to specify which functions in the custom library need type hinting. We override this method to handle the `my_library.my_function` function.

Inside the `handle_my_function` method, you can implement your custom type hinting logic. You can use the `ctx` parameter to analyze the function signature, arguments, and return type, and then return the inferred type.

## Registering the Type Hinting Plugin

To use the type hinting plugin in MyPy, you need to register it in your MyPy configuration file. Open your `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file and add the following snippet:

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = my_library:mypy_plugin
```

Replace `my_library:mypy_plugin` with the appropriate module and plugin name for your custom library.

## Running MyPy with the Type Hinting Plugin

With the plugin registered, you can now run MyPy with the type hinting support for your custom library. Assuming your custom library is installed in the Python environment, use the following command:

```bash
mypy your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the path to your Python script that uses your custom library. MyPy will now use the defined type hinting rules to validate the types in your custom library.

## Conclusion

Extending MyPy with type hinting plugins for custom libraries allows you to leverage the benefits of static type checking in your own codebase. By writing a type hinting plugin and registering it with MyPy, you can ensure that your custom library's types are properly inferred and validated.

Taking the time to add type hinting support to your custom libraries can significantly improve the maintainability and reliability of your code. Enjoy the benefits of static type checking in Python and make your code more robust!
