When working on large Python codebases, maintaining a consistent coding style and enforcing coding conventions becomes crucial. This not only helps improve code readability but also makes it easier for collaboration among team members. *MyPy* is a powerful static type checker for Python, but did you know that it can also be customized to enforce coding conventions?

In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage *MyPy plugins* to enforce coding conventions in Python, ensuring that your code follows the specified guidelines.

## What are MyPy plugins?

*MyPy plugins* are additional extensions that you can write to enhance the functionality of *MyPy*. These plugins allow you to perform custom analysis on your Python code, enabling you to enforce specific coding conventions and rules that go beyond the default type checking offered by *MyPy*.

## Installing MyPy plugins

Before we get started, make sure you have *MyPy* installed. You can install it via pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install mypy
```

To install a *MyPy plugin*, you need to download the plugin package and add it to your project's dependencies. The plugin package should contain a file named `mypy-plugin.py`. Let's assume we want to install a plugin called `mypy-plugin-example`. You can install it by running:

```python
pip install mypy-plugin-example
```

Once the plugin is installed, you need to enable it in your *MyPy* configuration file. Create a file named `mypy.ini` in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = mypy_plugin_example
```

Now, let's dive into some examples of how we can use *MyPy plugins* to enforce coding conventions in Python.

## Example 1: Enforcing naming conventions

A common coding convention is to use *snake_case* for variable and function names. To enforce this convention, we can create a *MyPy plugin* that checks if all variables and function names follow this naming style.

First, let's create the `mypy-plugin-example` package by following the plugin package structure guidelines. Inside the package, create a `mypy_plugin_example.py` file with the following code:

```python
from typing import List
from mypy.plugin import Plugin
from mypy.nodes import SymbolTableNode
from mypy.checker import TypeChecker

def enforce_naming_convention(ctx: Plugin, sym: SymbolTableNode) -> None:
    if sym.is_variable() or sym.is_function():
        name = sym.fullname.split('.')[-1]
        if '_' in name:
            ctx.msg.error(f"Invalid naming convention: {name}", ctx.context)

def plugin(_version: str) -> Plugin:
    return Plugin(mypy_version=_version,  # mypy version
                  default_options={},  # plugin options
                  plugin_version='1.0',
                  hooks={'symtable_node': enforce_naming_convention})
```

This plugin uses  the `symtable_node` hook to check each variable and function symbol table node. If the name contains an underscore, it raises an error indicating an invalid naming convention.

After creating the plugin, install it in your project, and enable it in the `mypy.ini` file as explained earlier. Now, whenever you run *MyPy*, it will analyze your code and display an error for any variable or function name that doesn't comply with the naming convention.

## Example 2: Enforcing code formatting rules

In addition to naming conventions, you might want to enforce specific code formatting rules like indentation, line length, or whitespace usage. For this example, let's create a *MyPy plugin* that checks if your code adheres to maximum line length.

Inside the `mypy-plugin-example` package, create a new `mypy_plugin_example.py` file with the following code:

```python
from typing import List
from mypy.plugin import Plugin
from mypy.nodes import FuncDef
from mypy.checker import TypeChecker

def enforce_line_length(ctx: Plugin, func: FuncDef) -> None:
    max_length = 80  # Set your desired maximum line length
    for statement in func.body:
        if statement.line:
            length = len(statement.line)
            if length > max_length:
                ctx.msg.error(f"Line exceeds maximum length ({max_length}): {statement.line}", statement)

def plugin(_version: str) -> Plugin:
    return Plugin(mypy_version=_version,  # mypy version
                  default_options={},  # plugin options
                  plugin_version='1.0',
                  hooks={'funcdef': enforce_line_length})
```

In this example, the `funcdef` hook is used to check each function definition. It iterates over the body of each function, checking the length of each line. If any line exceeds the specified maximum length, an error is raised.

By installing and enabling this plugin, you can ensure that your code doesn't exceed the specified line length, helping you maintain consistent code formatting across the project.

## Conclusion

By leveraging *MyPy plugins*, you can go beyond type checking and enforce specific coding conventions and rules in Python. Whether it is enforcing naming conventions, code formatting rules, or any other custom checks, *MyPy plugins* give you the power to tailor your static analysis to meet your project's needs.

Remember to regularly run *MyPy* with the enabled plugins to ensure your codebase conforms to the specified coding conventions, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.
