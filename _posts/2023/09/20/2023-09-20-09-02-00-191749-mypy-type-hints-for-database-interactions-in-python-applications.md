In modern Python applications, interacting with databases is a common requirement. To ensure code correctness and improve maintainability, we can leverage the MyPy static type checker and add type hints to our database interaction code.

## Why Use MyPy Type Hints?

By using type hints with MyPy, we can catch type-related errors before our code even runs. Type hints also provide valuable documentation for developers working on the codebase, making it easier to understand the expected types of inputs and outputs.

## Setting Up MyPy

Before we start adding type hints, we need to set up MyPy in our project. In your terminal, run the following commands:

```
pip install mypy
```

This installs the MyPy package. Next, create a `mypy.ini` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = sqlmypy
```

## Type Hints for SQLite Database

Let's consider an example where we are interacting with an SQLite database. We can use the `sqlite3` module to connect to the database and execute queries.

```python
import sqlite3
from typing import List, Tuple, Any

def get_user(username: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE username = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    return result

def insert_user(username: str, email: str) -> None:
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, email))
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```

In this example, we have two functions - `get_user` to retrieve user information and `insert_user` to insert a new user into the database.

## Adding Type Hints for SQLite Database Interactions

Let's enhance our code with MyPy type hints. We'll use the `sqlite3.Connection` and `sqlite3.Cursor` types to specify the connection and cursor objects.

```python
import sqlite3
from typing import List, Tuple, Any

def get_user(username: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    conn: sqlite3.Connection = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor: sqlite3.Cursor = conn.cursor()
    query: str = "SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE username = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    result: Tuple[str, str] = cursor.fetchone()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    return result

def insert_user(username: str, email: str) -> None:
    conn: sqlite3.Connection = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor: sqlite3.Cursor = conn.cursor()
    query: str = "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, email))
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```

By explicitly annotating the connection and cursor objects with their respective types, we provide additional information to MyPy about the types of these objects.

## Running MyPy

To check our code using MyPy, run the following command in your terminal:

```
mypy your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the actual filename of your Python script. MyPy will now analyze the code and report any type-related errors it finds.

## Conclusion

By using MyPy type hints in our database interaction code, we improve the maintainability and readability of our Python applications. Type hints help catch potential errors early and provide useful documentation for developers working on the codebase. Using static type checking tools like MyPy is a valuable practice for any Python developer. #Python #MyPy
