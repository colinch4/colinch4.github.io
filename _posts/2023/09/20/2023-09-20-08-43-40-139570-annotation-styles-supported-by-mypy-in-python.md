title: Annotation Styles Supported by MyPy in Python

MyPy is a type-checking tool for Python that can help catch errors and provide better code analysis. It supports several annotation styles, allowing developers to add type hints to their code and enable static type checking. In this blog post, we will explore the different annotation styles supported by MyPy.

### 1. Type Comments

One of the simplest ways to add type hints is by using type comments. You can add a type hint comment next to a variable or function, specifying the expected type. Here's an example:

```python
# type: int
x = 5
```

In the code snippet above, we are annotating variable `x` with the type `int`. MyPy will use this information to perform static type checking.

### 2. Function Annotations

Python supports function annotations, which can be used to specify the types of function parameters and return values. MyPy can leverage these annotations for type checking. Here's an example:

```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

In the code snippet above, we annotate the `add_numbers` function with type hints. Both parameters `a` and `b` are expected to be of type `int`. The function is also expected to return an `int` value.

### 3. Variable Annotations

Variable annotations allow you to add type hints to variables. This style is similar to type comments, but instead of annotating next to the assignment, you can annotate directly on the variable declaration. Here's an example:

```python
answer: int = 42
```

In the code snippet above, `answer` is annotated as an `int` variable.

### 4. Type Aliases

MyPy supports type aliases, which can be handy for complex or repetitive type annotations. You can define a type alias using the `TypeVar` function from the `typing` module. Here's an example:

```python
from typing import TypeVar

UserId = TypeVar('UserId', int, str)

def get_user(id: UserId) -> dict:
    # Retrieve user data based on the id
    pass
```

In the code snippet above, `UserId` is defined as a type alias that can either be an `int` or a `str`. The `get_user` function accepts an `id` parameter of type `UserId`, which can be either an `int` or a `str`.

Using these annotation styles supported by MyPy in Python, you can enhance your code's clarity and catch potential type errors before they cause runtime issues. Remember to run MyPy against your codebase to benefit from static type checking.
