Python is a dynamic typed language, which means that variables don't have a fixed type. While this flexibility offers many advantages, it can also lead to bugs and errors that are difficult to catch. To address this issue, various type checkers have been developed for Python. In this blog post, we will compare two popular ones: MyPy and PyType.

## MyPy

**MyPy** is a static type checker for Python developed by Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python itself. It aims to bring static type checking to Python code while maintaining maximum compatibility.

Key features of MyPy include:

- **Static typing**: MyPy allows you to add type annotations to your Python code, making it easy to catch type-related errors and bugs during the development process.
- **Gradual typing**: MyPy supports gradual typing, so you can start with untyped code and gradually add type annotations as your codebase grows.
- **Type inference**: MyPy has a powerful type inference system that can automatically infer types based on your code, reducing the need for excessive type annotations.
- **IDE integration**: MyPy works seamlessly with popular IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Sublime Text, providing real-time type checking and autocompletion support.

To use MyPy, you simply run it as a separate command in your terminal, passing the path to your Python files as arguments. MyPy will analyze your code and report any type errors it finds.

```python
# Example usage of MyPy
# main.py
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, "10")  # type error
```

## PyType

**PyType** is another static type checker for Python, developed by Google. It focuses on providing precise and efficient type inference for large codebases.

Key features of PyType include:

- **Precise type inference**: PyType uses a combination of static analysis and type inference techniques to derive the most accurate types for your Python code.
- **Optimized for large codebases**: PyType is designed to handle large, complex codebases efficiently, making it suitable for projects of any size.
- **Integration with Google's tools**: PyType is part of Google's suite of Python developer tools, allowing for seamless integration with other tools like Google Test and Google Mock.
- **Support for Python 3.7+**: PyType supports the latest versions of Python, including the latest language features.

To use PyType, you need to install it using `pip`, and then run it as a command-line tool, passing the path to your Python files as arguments. PyType will analyze your code and provide detailed type information and error messages.

```python
# Example usage of PyType
# main.py
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, "10")  # type error
```
