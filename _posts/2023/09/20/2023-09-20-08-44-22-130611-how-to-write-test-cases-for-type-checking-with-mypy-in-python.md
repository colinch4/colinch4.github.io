In this blog post, we will discuss how to write test cases specifically for type checking in Python using MyPy. Type checking is an important process that helps catch potential errors in your code before they become runtime issues.

## Installing MyPy

Before we start writing test cases, we need to make sure we have MyPy installed in our Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

Once MyPy is installed, we can proceed with writing our test cases.

## Writing Test Cases

### 1. Define the Function

Let's consider an example where we have a function called `calculate_sum` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum:

```python
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

### 2. Create Test Cases

Next, we need to create the test cases to check if the type annotations defined in the function signature are correct. We can use the `assert` statement to assert the expected type against the actual type:

```python
def test_calculate_sum():
    # Test case 1: Valid input
    result = calculate_sum(2, 3)
    assert isinstance(result, int)

    # Test case 2: Invalid input
    result = calculate_sum("2", 3)
    assert isinstance(result, int)
```

In the above example, we have two test cases. The first one passes valid input (`2` and `3`), and the second test case deliberately passes an invalid input (`"2"` and `3`) to trigger a type error.

### 3. Run MyPy

Once we have written our test cases, we can run MyPy to perform the type checking:

```bash
mypy your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python script that contains the `calculate_sum` function and the test cases. MyPy will scan the script and flag any type errors it detects.

If there are type errors, MyPy will display an error message indicating the lines where the errors occurred and the reasons for the error.

### Conclusion

Writing test cases for type checking is an effective way to ensure the correctness and consistency of types in your Python codebase. By using MyPy, you can catch type errors early in the development process and improve the overall quality of your code.
