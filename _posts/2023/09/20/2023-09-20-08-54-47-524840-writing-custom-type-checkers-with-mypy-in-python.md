In Python, type annotations can be added to the code using the `typing` module to provide hints about the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values. This helps to improve code clarity and catch potential type errors early on.

[Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) is a powerful static type checker for Python that can verify the correctness of type annotations. While Mypy comes with a wide range of built-in type checkers, it also provides the flexibility to write custom type checkers to meet specific project requirements.

In this blog post, we will explore how to write custom type checkers using Mypy in Python.

## Benefits of custom type checkers

Custom type checkers can be useful in scenarios where standard type checkers may not cover specific domain-specific type rules or validations. By writing custom type checkers, you can enforce stricter type checking and ensure the correctness of type annotations based on your project's specific constraints.

## Getting started

To get started, make sure you have Mypy installed in your Python environment. You can install Mypy by running the following command:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

Once installed, you can start writing custom type checkers.

## Writing a custom type checker

To write a custom type checker, follow these steps:

1. **Create a custom plugin**: Create a new Python module to house your custom type checker. This module will act as a plugin for Mypy. For example, let's create a module named `custom_type_checker.py`.
2. **Import Mypy's plugin API**: In the `custom_type_checker.py` module, import the necessary APIs from `mypy.plugin`.
3. **Define a callback function**: Define a callback function that will be invoked by Mypy for each type checking step. This function should take the type checker instance as an argument and perform the necessary type checks.
4. **Implement your custom type checks**: Within the callback function, implement your custom type checks by leveraging the APIs provided by Mypy. You can access the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the code being checked and perform type validation based on your project's requirements.
5. **Register the custom plugin**: Finally, register the custom plugin with Mypy by defining an entry point using `mypy.plugin.main`, providing the name of the callback function.

Here's an example of a custom type checker that verifies if a list has more than a certain number of elements:

```python
import ast

from mypy.plugin import Plugin, FunctionContext
from mypy.types import CallableType

def custom_type_checker(ctx: FunctionContext) -> None:
    if ctx.context == 'terse':
        node = ctx.defn
        if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef) and isinstance(node.returns, ast.NameConstant):
            if isinstance(node.returns.value, int) and node.returns.value < 10:
                ctx.api.fail(f"Return type should be greater than 10 but got {node.returns.value}",
                             node.returns)

def custom_plugin(_: str) -> Plugin:
    return Plugin(callback=custom_type_checker)

def mypy_custom_type_checker():
    return custom_plugin
```

To use this custom type checker, run Mypy with the `--plugin` flag and specify the module where the custom plugin is located:

```bash
mypy --plugin custom_type_checker.py mymodule.py
```

## Conclusion

Writing custom type checkers with MyPy empowers you to enforce stricter type checking and ensure the correctness of your codebase's type annotations. By leveraging the flexibility of MyPy, you can tailor the type checker to suit your project's specific requirements.

By incorporating custom type checkers into your development process, you can catch type errors early, improve code quality, and enhance the overall maintainability of your Python projects.
