MyPy is a static type checker for Python that helps catch type-related bugs and provides better tooling for writing robust and maintainable code. While basic type annotations are supported out of the box, MyPy also offers several advanced type system features that can further enhance the expressiveness and correctness of your code. In this article, we will explore some of these advanced features and how they can be used.

## 1. Union Types

Union types allow you to specify that a value can be of multiple types. This can be helpful when a function or a variable can accept different input types. To define a union type, you just need to use the `|` operator between the types:

```python
def process_input(data: str | int) -> None:
    if isinstance(data, str):
        # Handle string input
        ...
    elif isinstance(data, int):
        # Handle integer input
        ...
    else:
        # Handle other types
        ...
```

By using union types, you can make your code more flexible and handle different scenarios without sacrificing type safety.

## 2. Intersection Types

Intersection types allow you to specify that a value must conform to multiple types. This can be useful when you need to work with objects that have properties or methods from multiple interfaces or classes. To define an intersection type, you can use the `&` operator:

```python
class Printable:
    def print(self) -> None:
        ...

class Serializable:
    def serialize(self) -> str:
    ...

def process_object(obj: Printable & Serializable) -> None:
    obj.print()
    serialized_string = obj.serialize()
    ...
```

By using intersection types, you can ensure that the passed object supports both the `Printable` and `Serializable` interfaces, and safely call their respective methods.

## Conclusion

MyPy's advanced type system features, such as union types and intersection types, provide powerful tools for writing more expressive and type-safe code. By leveraging these features, you can catch potential bugs at compile-time and improve the maintainability of your codebase. So, if you're looking to level up your Python code with static type checking, be sure to explore and utilize the advanced features offered by MyPy.
