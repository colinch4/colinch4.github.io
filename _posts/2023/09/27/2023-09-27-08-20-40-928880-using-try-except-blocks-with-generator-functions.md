In Python, generator functions are powerful tools for creating iterators. They allow you to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly instead of storing them all in memory at once. However, when working with generator functions, it's important to handle exceptions properly to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure the code's robustness.

## Error Handling in Generator Functions

Generator functions can encounter exceptions just like regular functions. However, the way exceptions are handled in generator functions differs slightly. Normally, when an exception is raised in a generator function, it propagates to the caller, terminating the generator. 

To robustly handle exceptions in generator functions, we can use the `try-except` blocks within the generator function definition. This allows us to catch specific exceptions and handle them gracefully without terminating the generator prematurely.

## Example: Handling ZeroDivisionError

Let's consider an example where we have a generator function that divides some numbers by a given divisor:

```python
def divide_numbers(numbers, divisor):
    for num in numbers:
        try:
            yield num / divisor
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            yield "Error: Division by zero"
```

In this example, the `divide_numbers` generator function receives a sequence of numbers and a divisor. Inside the function, a `try-except` block is used to handle the `ZeroDivisionError` exception that might occur when dividing the numbers.

Whenever a division by zero error occurs, instead of raising an exception and terminating the generator, the `except` block catches the exception, and the generator yields a custom error message.

## Conclusion

When working with generator functions in Python, it's essential to handle exceptions gracefully. By using `try-except` blocks within the generator function definition, we can handle specific exceptions without prematurely terminating the generator.

By incorporating proper error handling techniques, we can ensure the code's robustness, maintain expected behavior, and provide informative error messages when necessary.
