In software development, it's common to work with multiple stages of data processing, where the output of one stage becomes the input of the next. The pipeline pattern is a way to organize and manage these stages by connecting them together in a sequential manner.

One powerful technique for implementing the pipeline pattern is by using generator functions in languages like Python.

## What is a Generator Function?

A generator function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing it to produce a sequence of values over time. It uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return`.

Here's an example of a simple generator function that produces a sequence of numbers:

```python
def number_generator():
    num = 0
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1
```

When called, this function returns a generator object. Each time the `yield` statement is executed, the current value of `num` is emitted from the generator. The function execution is then suspended until the next value is requested.

## Creating a Pipeline with Generator Functions

To implement a pipeline using generator functions, we can define each stage of the pipeline as a separate generator and chain them together. Each stage takes the output of the previous stage as input and produces a transformed output.

Here's an example of a pipeline that squares the numbers produced by the `number_generator`:

```python
def square_numbers(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        yield num ** 2

def pipeline():
    numbers = number_generator()
    squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)

    return squared_numbers
```

In this example, the `pipeline` function creates instances of the generator functions and chains them together. The `square_numbers` generator takes the numbers generated by `number_generator` and squares them.

## Consuming the Pipeline Output

To consume the output of the pipeline, we can iterate over the final generator returned by the `pipeline` function:

```python
pipeline_gen = pipeline()

for _ in range(5):
    result = next(pipeline_gen)
    print(result)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to get the first 5 squared numbers from the pipeline. The `next` function is used to retrieve the next value from the generator.

## Benefits of Using Generator Functions for Pipelines

Using generator functions for implementing pipelines offers several benefits:

- **Lazy evaluation**: Generator functions allow for demand-driven evaluation, meaning each stage of the pipeline is only computed when necessary. This can be efficient when processing large amounts of data or in scenarios where some stages might be costly.
- **Modularity**: Each stage of the pipeline can be defined as a separate generator function, making the pipeline modular and easier to maintain.
- **Memory efficiency**: Generator functions produce one item at a time, reducing memory usage compared to generating all items at once.
