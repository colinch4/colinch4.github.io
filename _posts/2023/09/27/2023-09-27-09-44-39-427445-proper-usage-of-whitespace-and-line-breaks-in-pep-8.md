## Why does whitespace matter?

Whitespace, including spaces and tabs, is used to separate and organize code elements. It allows for better readability and improves the overall appearance of your code. Consistent use of whitespace enhances code maintainability and collaboration, making it easier for developers to understand and work with your code.

## Indentation and line breaks

1. Use **four spaces** per indentation level. Avoid using tabs or a mix of spaces and tabs. This ensures consistent visual indentation across different text editors and avoids any formatting discrepancies.

    ```python
    def my_function():
        if condition:
            statement
    ```

2. Limit lines to a maximum of **79 characters**. This promotes readability, especially when viewing code side by side or on smaller screens. If the line exceeds this limit, break it into multiple lines and use appropriate indentation.

    ```python
    # Bad
    long_variable_name = excessively_long_function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3, argument4)

    # Good
    long_variable_name = excessively_long_function_name(
        argument1, argument2, argument3, argument4
    )
    ```

3. When using parentheses or brackets, consider breaking the line immediately after the opening parenthesis or bracket. Align subsequent lines with the opening delimiter to improve clarity.

    ```python
    # Bad
    my_list = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', 'item5']

    # Good
    my_list = [
        'item1',
        'item2',
        'item3',
        'item4',
        'item5',
    ]
    ```

## Whitespace guidelines

1. Separate functions and classes with **two blank lines**. This visually distinguishes different code blocks and improves readability.

2. Use **one blank line** between method definitions and within functions to group related statements.

3. Avoid whitespace directly inside parentheses, brackets, or braces following function calls or indexing/slicing.

    ```python
    # Bad
    my_function( arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 )

    # Good
    my_function(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
    ```

4. Surround binary operators with a **single space** on either side to improve readability.

    ```python
    # Bad
    result=x+y

    # Good
    result = x + y
    ```

5. Don't use excessive whitespace, such as multiple blank lines in a row. This can create unnecessary clutter in your code.

## Wrapping up

Following the whitespace and line break guidelines outlined in PEP 8 can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your Python code. By consistently applying these guidelines, you ensure that your code is clear, professional-looking, and easy to collaborate on.

Remember to use appropriate indentation, limit line lengths, and utilize whitespace effectively. By doing so, you will make your code more accessible to other developers and contribute to a more harmonious and efficient coding environment.
