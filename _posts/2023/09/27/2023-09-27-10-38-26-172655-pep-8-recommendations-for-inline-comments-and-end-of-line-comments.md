When writing code, it's important to not only focus on functionality but also on code readability and maintainability. One aspect that can greatly impact code readability is the use of comments. In this blog post, we will explore the recommendations provided by PEP 8 for writing inline comments and end-of-line comments.

### Inline Comments
Inline comments are used to annotate specific lines of code and provide additional information or context. Here are some recommendations for writing inline comments:

1. **Keep inline comments concise**: Avoid long-winded explanations in inline comments. Instead, focus on providing short and meaningful annotations that aid understanding.
2. **Use inline comments sparingly**: Inline comments should be used to clarify code that is difficult to understand at a glance. If the code itself is clear, you may not need an inline comment.
3. **Place inline comments on a separate line**: To maximize readability, start inline comments on a new line, rather than at the end of a line of code.
4. **Begin inline comments with a hash symbol**: Start inline comments with the '#' symbol to clearly indicate that it is a comment.

Example of inline comments in Python:

```python
x = 5  # Assigning a value to variable x
result = calculate(y)  # Calling the calculate function with argument y
```

### End-of-Line Comments
End-of-line comments are used to provide additional information or context at the end of a line of code. Here are some recommendations for writing end-of-line comments:

1. **Keep end-of-line comments short**: Similar to inline comments, end-of-line comments should be concise and to the point. They should provide a quick insight into the purpose of the code.
2. **Start end-of-line comments with a hash symbol and two spaces**: To differentiate end-of-line comments from inline comments, start them with the '#' symbol followed by two spaces.

Example of end-of-line comments in Python:

```python
result = calculate(x)  # Calling the calculate function with argument x  # Returns the result of the calculation
```

By following these recommendations, you can make your code more readable and understandable, allowing for easier collaboration with other developers and making maintenance tasks less arduous.
