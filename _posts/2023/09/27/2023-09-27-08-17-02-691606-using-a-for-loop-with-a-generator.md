When dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, using a generator can be an efficient and memory-friendly approach. Generators allow us to iterate over a sequence of values without loading them all into memory at once. One common way to work with generators is by using a `for` loop to iterate over the values they generate.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use a `for` loop with a generator in Python:

```python
def even_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

# Using a for loop with the even_numbers generator
for num in even_numbers(10):
    print(num)
```

In this example, we define a `even_numbers` function that generates even numbers up to a given value `n`. Instead of returning a list of all even numbers, the function uses the `yield` keyword to create a generator.

The `for` loop then iterates over the values generated by the `even_numbers` generator. In each iteration, the `num` variable is assigned the next value generated by the generator. We can then perform any desired operations on each value, such as printing it in this case.

The advantage of using a generator in this situation is that it generates and yields each even number one at a time, only when requested by the `for` loop. This avoids the need to store all the even numbers in memory at once, which can be useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

By using a `for` loop with a generator, we can efficiently iterate over values without loading the entire sequence into memory. This approach is particularly useful in situations where memory is a concern or when dealing with large amounts of data.
