1. Break the expression into multiple lines: When an expression becomes too long to fit within the recommended line length of 79 characters, it is advisable to break it into multiple lines. Use parentheses to maintain the logical structure of the expression. For example:

   ```python
   result = (very_long_variable_name1 + very_long_variable_name2 -
             very_long_variable_name3 * very_long_variable_name4 +
             very_long_variable_name5 / very_long_variable_name6)
   ```

   This makes the expression easier to read and understand.

2. Assign intermediate values to variables: If the expression is particularly complex, it may be beneficial to assign intermediate values to variables with meaningful names. This not only improves readability but also helps in debugging and maintenance. For instance:

   ```python
   intermediate_value1 = very_long_variable_name1 + very_long_variable_name2
   intermediate_value2 = very_long_variable_name3 * very_long_variable_name4
   intermediate_value3 = very_long_variable_name5 / very_long_variable_name6
   result = intermediate_value1 - intermediate_value2 + intermediate_value3
   ```

   Breaking down the expression into smaller parts can make it more manageable and easier to comprehend.

3. Use logical operators and functions: If the expression involves multiple conditions, consider using logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. Additionally, you can create helper functions to encapsulate complex logic. This helps in improving the clarity and understandability of the code. For example:

   ```python
   def is_valid(value):
       return value > 0 and value < 10
    
   if is_valid(x) or is_valid(y) and is_valid(z):
       # Perform actions
   ```

   Using logical operators and functions can simplify complex expressions and make your code more maintainable.

By following these recommendations, you can effectively handle long and complex expressions while adhering to the PEP 8 guidelines. Writing clean and readable code not only benefits you but also makes it easier for others to understand and maintain your code.

Remember to keep your code organized and follow the suggested practices mentioned in PEP 8.

Feel free to share your thoughts or any other approaches you use to handle complex expressions.
