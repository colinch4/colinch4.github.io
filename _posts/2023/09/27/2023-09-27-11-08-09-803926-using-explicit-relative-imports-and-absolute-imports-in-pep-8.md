In Python, imports serve as a way to bring in functionality from other modules or packages. They allow us to reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel. However, the way we import modules can have an impact on code readability and maintainability.

Explicit relative imports are recommended when we're importing from within the same package or module. They provide a clear indication that the import is happening locally, within the current package or module. To use explicit relative imports, we prepend a dot to the module name, indicating that it is relative to the current location.

For example, if we have a package called "my_package" with two modules, "module1.py" and "module2.py", and we want to import something from "module1.py" into "module2.py", we can use explicit relative import like this:

```python
from .module1 import MyClass
```

This makes it clear that we are importing "MyClass" from within the same package.

On the other hand, absolute imports are recommended when importing from external packages or modules that are not part of the current package. Absolute imports specify the full path to the module from the project root.

For instance, if we want to import the "math" module, which is part of the Python standard library, we would write:

```python
import math
```

This tells Python to look for the "math" module in the standard library or installed packages.

By using explicit relative imports within our package and absolute imports when accessing external modules, we ensure consistent and clear import statements throughout our codebase. Following this approach makes it easier to understand the import dependencies and avoids naming clashes.

Remember, using explicit relative imports and absolute imports not only follows the PEP 8 guidelines but also enhances code readability and maintainability. So, make it a habit to choose the appropriate import style when working on your Python projects.
