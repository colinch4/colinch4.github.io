According to PEP 8, the recommended maximum line length is 79 characters. This limit ensures that the code remains readable without the need for horizontal scrolling in most text editors and terminals.

However, PEP 8 acknowledges that exceeding this limit is sometimes inevitable, especially when working with long URLs or complex mathematical expressions. In such cases, a maximum line length of 99 characters is considered acceptable.

To maintain compliance with PEP 8, you can use a combination of techniques to handle longer lines:

1. **Line continuation**: If a statement exceeds the designated line length, you can break it into multiple lines by utilizing parentheses or backslashes as line continuation characters.

```python
result = (long_variable_name_one +
          long_variable_name_two +
          long_variable_name_three)
```

2. **String concatenation**: When working with long strings, you can concatenate them using the `+` operator to avoid exceeding the line length limit.

```python
message = "This is a very long string that can be " + \
          "concatenated to continue on the next line."
```

3. **String formatting**: Another approach is to use string formatting to break long lines and make the code more readable.

```python
message = (
    f"This is a very long string that can be "
    f"formatted to continue on the next line with"
    f"some variables: {variable1}, {variable2}."
)
```

4. **Extract variables**: If a line becomes too long due to complex expressions, consider extracting parts of the expression into separate variables. This improves code readability and reduces line length.

```python
complex_expression = long_variable_name_one * long_variable_name_two + \
                    long_variable_name_three / long_variable_name_four

# Can be restructured as:
part_one = long_variable_name_one * long_variable_name_two
part_two = long_variable_name_three / long_variable_name_four
complex_expression = part_one + part_two
```

By following the recommended line length limits outlined in PEP 8, and utilizing techniques like line continuation, string concatenation, string formatting, and extracting variables, you can ensure your Python code remains clean, readable, and adheres to best practices.
