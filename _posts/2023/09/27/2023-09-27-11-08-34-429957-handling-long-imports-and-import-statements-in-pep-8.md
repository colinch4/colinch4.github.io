Are you tired of writing long import statements that span multiple lines and make your code look cluttered? Have you heard of PEP 8, the official style guide for Python? In this blog post, we will explore some guidelines and best practices for handling long imports and import statements in accordance with PEP 8.

Use Import As to Reduce Line Length

One way to handle long import statements is to use the import as syntax provided by Python. This allows you to assign a shorter name or alias to a module or package, making your import statements more concise. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In the above code snippet, we have imported the popular data analysis library 'pandas' as 'pd', the numerical computing library 'numpy' as 'np', and the plotting library 'matplotlib.pyplot' as 'plt'. By using these aliases, we can now refer to these modules using their shorter names throughout our code.

Grouping Imports

Another guideline mentioned in PEP 8 is to group imports in the following order: standard library imports, third-party library imports, and local application or project imports. Additionally, it is recommended that each group of imports be separated by a blank line. Here's an example:

```python
import os
import sys

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from my_app.models import User, Product
from my_app.views import home, about
```

In the above code snippet, the standard library imports (os and sys) are grouped together followed by the third-party library imports (numpy and pandas), and finally the local application imports (User, Product, home, and about).

Wrapping Long Import Statements

In cases where the import statements exceed the recommended line length of 79 characters in PEP 8, you can wrap the statements using parentheses or a backslash. Here's an example:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris, \
    load_boston
```

or

```python
from sklearn.datasets import (load_iris,
                               load_boston)
```

Both of these styles are acceptable and help maintain readability.

Using Multiple Import Statements

If you have a large number of imports from a single module, you can choose to import each item individually on separate lines or import them all in a single line. Both styles are considered valid in PEP 8, but consistency within your codebase is encouraged. Here's an example of both styles:

```python
from math import sqrt, sin, cos, tan
```

or

```python
from math import (sqrt, 
                  sin, 
                  cos, 
                  tan)
```

Remember to use the style that best suits your codebase and make sure to adhere to it consistently.

Conclusion

By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in PEP 8, you can effectively handle long imports and import statements in your Python code. Using import as to assign shorter names, grouping imports in a logical order, wrapping long import statements, and being consistent in your style choices will result in more readable and maintainable code.
