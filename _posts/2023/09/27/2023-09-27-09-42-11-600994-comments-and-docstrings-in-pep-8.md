Code comments and docstrings are crucial for documenting and explaining your code to make it more understandable and maintainable. They serve as a form of documentation for other developers, as well as for future-you when you revisit the code.

According to PEP 8, the official style guide for Python code, comments should be clear, concise, and avoid stating the obvious. They should explain why and how the code is achieving a certain goal, rather than describing what the code is doing. Let's delve into some best practices for writing comments and docstrings.

## Comments
1. **Be concise**: Keep your comments short and to the point.
2. **Avoid stating the obvious**: Comments should provide additional insights or explain complex sections of code.
3. **Use clear language**: Write comments in a style that is easy to read and understand. Use proper grammar and punctuation.
4. **Avoid excessive commenting**: A well-structured, self-explanatory code should minimize the need for excessive comments.
5. **Keep comments up to date**: When you modify code, make sure to update the relevant comments accordingly.
6. **Commenting out code**: Avoid leaving commented-out code in your codebase. Use version control systems to track changes instead.

Here's an example of a good comment:

```python
# Calculate the average of the values in the numbers list
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

## Docstrings
1. **Use triple quotes**: Docstrings should be enclosed in triple quotes (`"""`) and placed immediately after the function, class, or module definition.
2. **Follow the format**: PEP 257 provides guidance for the format of docstrings, including using one-line or multi-line docstrings.
3. **Provide clear function descriptions**: Explain what the function does, its parameters, and return values.
4. **Document parameters and return values**: Describe the purpose, data types, and any constraints of the function's parameters. Specify the type and meaning of the returned values.
5. **Include examples when necessary**: If a function has a specific usage pattern or important details to note, include examples in the docstring.

Here's an example of a good docstring:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of the values in the given list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to calculate the average from.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers in the list.
    """
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return average
```

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your comments and docstrings are valuable additions to your codebase, making it easier for other developers (including yourself) to understand and maintain the code in the future.
