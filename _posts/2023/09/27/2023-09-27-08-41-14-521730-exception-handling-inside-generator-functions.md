However, dealing with exceptions inside generator functions can be a bit tricky. When an exception occurs inside a generator function, it is raised within the function, but the generator object itself is not aware of it. Trying to handle exceptions in the usual try-except blocks may not work as expected.

To effectively handle exceptions inside generator functions, you can use the `throw()` method provided by generator objects. This method allows you to raise exceptions from outside the generator, causing it to catch and handle them accordingly.

Let's take a look at an example that demonstrates exception handling inside a generator function:

```python
def generate_numbers():
    try:
        for i in range(10):
            if i == 5:
                raise ValueError("Value 5 is not allowed!")
            yield i
    except ValueError as e:
        yield str(e)

numbers_generator = generate_numbers()

for number in numbers_generator:
    print(number)
    if isinstance(number, str):
        break

```

In this example, we define a generator function called `generate_numbers()`. Inside the function, we use a `try` block to generate a sequence of numbers using the `yield` keyword. However, when `i` reaches 5, we intentionally raise a `ValueError`.

To catch this exception, we place the `yield` statement inside the `try` block. In the `except` block, we yield the exception message as a string.

Outside the generator function, we create a generator object called `numbers_generator` using `generate_numbers()`. We then iterate over the values generated by the generator using a `for` loop. If the value yielded is a string (indicating an exception occurred), we break the loop.

By using this approach, we can effectively handle exceptions occurring inside a generator function. The `throw()` method provides a way to raise and catch exceptions within the generator, allowing for more robust error handling.
