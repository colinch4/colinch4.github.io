# Chaining Multiple Generators Together in Python

Generators are a powerful tool in Python, allowing us to iterate over a sequence of values without having to store them in memory. One of the great features of generators is that they can be chained together to create complex sequences of values on the fly. In this blog post, we will explore how to chain multiple generators together in Python.

## Understanding Generators

Before we dive into chaining generators, let's quickly recap what generators are in Python. A generator is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed during execution. When a generator is called, it returns an iterator object that can be iterated over to generate a series of values. Each value is produced using the `yield` keyword.

Here's an example of a simple generator that generates a series of squares:

```python
def square_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2

squares = square_generator(5)
for square in squares:
    print(square)
```

Output:
```
0
1
4
9
16
```

## Chaining Generators

Chaining generators involves using the `yield from` syntax to delegate the generation of values to another generator. This allows us to create a new generator that combines the values produced by multiple generators into a single sequence.

Here's an example of chaining two generators together:

```python
def evens(n):
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

def odds(n):
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            yield i

def both(n):
    yield from evens(n)
    yield from odds(n)

numbers = both(10)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

Output:
```
0
2
4
6
8
1
3
5
7
9
```

In the example above, we have three generators: `evens`, `odds`, and `both`. The `evens` generator produces even numbers, the `odds` generator produces odd numbers, and the `both` generator chains these two generators together. By using `yield from`, the `both` generator delegates the generation of values to both `evens` and `odds`, resulting in a sequence of both even and odd numbers.

## Conclusion

Chaining multiple generators together can be a powerful technique in Python, allowing us to create complex sequences of values by combining smaller generators. With the `yield from` syntax, we can easily delegate the generation of values to other generators and create more flexible and reusable generator functions.

By using generators and chaining them together, we can write more efficient and memory-friendly code, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

Happy coding!
