### String Literals

String literals are enclosed in either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). It is recommended to **be consistent** and use one style consistently throughout your codebase.

For example:

```python
name = "John Doe"
message = 'Hello, World!'
```

### Multiline Strings

Sometimes, you may need to work with multiline strings. In such cases, you can use triple quotes (''' ''') or triple double quotes (""" """). This allows you to write strings spanning multiple lines without having to use explicit line breaks.

It is important to note that **PEP 8 recommends triple double quotes for docstrings** (documentation strings). Docstrings are used to document functions, classes, and modules.

For example:

```python
long_description = '''This is a long
multiline string. It
spans multiple lines.'''
```

or

```python
def my_function():
    """
    This is a docstring.

    It provides a description
    of the function.
    """
    # function body
```

### Handling Long Strings

PEP 8 suggests a couple of options for handling long string literals or docstrings that exceed the recommended line length limit of 79 characters.

- **Implicit Line Continuation**: You can use parentheses to split a long string into multiple lines. This allows you to continue the string on the next line without using any string concatenation or a backslash.

```python
long_string = ("This is a very long string that exceeds the "
               "recommended line length limit of 79 characters.")
```

- **Explicit Line Continuation**: If you prefer not to use parentheses, you can use backslashes (\) to explicitly continue the string to the next line. However, this approach is generally discouraged unless necessary for backward compatibility.

```python
long_string = "This is a very long string that exceeds the " \
              "recommended line length limit of 79 characters."
```

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Python code adheres to PEP 8 recommendations while handling string literals and multiline strings.
