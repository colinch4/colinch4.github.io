Generators are an important concept in Python that allow us to create iterators. They are defined using a special type of function called a generator function. In Python, we can use the `return` and `yield` keywords inside a generator function to return values.

Although `return` and `yield` may seem similar, they have distinct differences. Understanding these differences is crucial in order to use generators effectively. Let's dive into the disparities between `return` and `yield` in generators.

## `return` in generators
When a generator encounters a `return` statement, it raises a `StopIteration` exception, indicating that there are no more values to yield. This essentially terminates the generator function. 

Here's an example to illustrate the behavior of `return` in a generator:

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    return 3

gen = my_generator()

for value in gen:
    print(value)
```

The output of the above code snippet would be:
```
1
2
```
Once the `return` statement is encountered, the generator stops producing values, and the loop exits.

## `yield` in generators
On the other hand, `yield` is used to temporarily suspend the execution of a generator function and output a value. Each time the generator encounters a `yield` statement, it pauses and returns the value specified.

Consider the following example:

```python
def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

fib_gen = fibonacci()

for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fib_gen))
```

This code generates the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a generator. The `yield` statement allows the generator function to pause and produce each value one at a time.

## Conclusion
In summary, the main difference between `return` and `yield` in generators is that `return` terminates the generator, while `yield` temporarily suspends the execution and produces a value. Understanding these distinctions is crucial when working with generators in Python.
