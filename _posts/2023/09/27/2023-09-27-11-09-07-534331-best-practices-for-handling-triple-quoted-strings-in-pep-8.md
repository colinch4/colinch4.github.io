Here are some best practices for handling triple-quoted strings in accordance with PEP 8:

1. Use double quotes for docstrings: PEP 8 recommends using double quotes for docstrings. This helps to maintain consistency within the codebase.

  ```python
  def my_function():
      """
      This is a docstring using double quotes.
      """
      pass
  ```

2. Indent triple-quoted strings properly: Triple-quoted strings should be indented to the same level as the surrounding code. This helps to maintain readability and makes it clear that the string is part of the code and not a separate block.

  ```python
  def my_function():
      """
      This is a docstring.
      """
      pass
  ```

3. Use single quotes for multiline strings within code: If you need to define multiline strings within your code, use single quotes instead of double quotes. This distinction helps to differentiate between docstrings and regular multiline strings.

  ```python
  def my_function():
      message = '''
      This is a multiline string within code.
      '''
  ```

4. Avoid extraneous whitespace in triple-quoted strings: PEP 8 recommends avoiding extraneous whitespace in triple-quoted strings, especially at the beginning or end of lines. This helps to maintain consistency and improve code readability.

  ```python
  def my_function():
      """
      This is a properly formatted docstring.
      """
      pass
  ```

In conclusion, following these best practices will help ensure that your code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines when handling triple-quoted strings. By doing so, you can maintain a clean and consistent codebase that is easy to read and understand.
