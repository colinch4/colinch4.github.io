PEP 8 is a popular style guide for Python code, which provides recommendations for how to format your code to enhance readability and maintainability. When working with lists, tuples, and dictionaries, following the formatting rules outlined in PEP 8 can make your code more consistent and easier to understand.

## Lists

1. **Indentation**: Indent all the elements of a list uniformly.
    ```python
    fruits = [
        'apple',
        'banana',
        'orange',
        'kiwi'
    ]
    ```

2. **Line Length**: If a list is too long to fit on a line, use multiple lines with the closing bracket aligned with the first character of the first element.
    ```python
    fruits = [
        'apple', 'banana', 'orange',
        'kiwi', 'mango', 'strawberry'
    ]
    ```

3. **Trailing Comma**: For lists with multiple elements, place a trailing comma after the last element.
    ```python
    fruits = [
        'apple',
        'banana',
        'orange',
    ]
    ```

## Tuples

1. **Indentation**: Indent all the elements of a tuple uniformly.
    ```python
    point = (
        10,
        20,
        30
    )
    ```

2. **Line Length**: If a tuple is too long to fit on a line, use multiple lines with the closing parenthesis aligned with the first character of the first element.
    ```python
    point = (
        10, 20,
        30, 40,
        50, 60
    )
    ```

3. **Trailing Comma**: For tuples with multiple elements, place a trailing comma after the last element.
    ```python
    point = (
        10,
        20,
        30,
    )
    ```

## Dictionaries

1. **Indentation**: Indent all the key-value pairs of a dictionary uniformly.
    ```python
    person = {
        'name': 'John',
        'age': 30,
        'city': 'New York'
    }
    ```

2. **Line Length**: If a dictionary is too long to fit on a line, use multiple lines with the closing brace aligned with the first character of the first key.
    ```python
    person = {
        'name': 'John', 'age': 30,
        'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA'
    }
    ```

3. **Trailing Comma**: For dictionaries with multiple key-value pairs, place a trailing comma after the last pair.
    ```python
    person = {
        'name': 'John',
        'age': 30,
        'city': 'New York',
    }
    ```

By adhering to these formatting rules, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your code, making it easier for you and other developers to work with. Remember to always strive for consistency in your codebase. #PEP8 #PythonSyntax
