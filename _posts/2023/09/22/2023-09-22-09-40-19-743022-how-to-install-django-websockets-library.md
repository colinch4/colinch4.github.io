In this tutorial, we will go through the steps on how to install the Django Websockets library, allowing you to implement real-time communication in your Django web applications.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed on your system
- Django framework installed
- Pip package installer

## Step 1: Create a virtual environment (optional)
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to ensure the library's installation does not interfere with other projects. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- For macOS/Linux:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
- For Windows:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 2: Install Django Channels

Django Channels is a core dependency for using websockets in Django. We will install it using pip:

```bash
pip install channels
```

## Step 3: Install Channels Redis (optional)

While Django Channels comes with a built-in development server, for production use, it is recommended to use a channel layer like Redis. To install Channels Redis, run the following command:

```bash
pip install channels_redis
```

## Step 4: Configure Django

Open your Django project's settings file (`settings.py`) and add the following configuration to enable the channels:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'channels',
]

CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
        'CONFIG': {
            'hosts': [('localhost', 6379)],
        },
    },
}
```

## Step 5: Test the installation

To verify that the installation was successful, let's create a simple websocket consumer. 

Create a new file called `consumers.py` in one of your Django app directories and add the following code:

```python
# consumers.py

from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class MyConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        await self.send(text_data='You said: {}'.format(text_data))
```

To map the consumer to a URL route, open `routing.py` located in your project's root directory and add the following code:

```python
# routing.py

from django.urls import path
from . import consumers

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    path('ws/', consumers.MyConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

## Step 6: Run the development server

Finally, start the Django development server to test the websocket functionality:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/` in your web browser and you should see the websocket connection established.

That's it! You have successfully installed the Django Websockets library and implemented a basic websocket consumer in your Django application.
