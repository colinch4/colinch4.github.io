Websockets have become an integral part of modern web applications as they provide real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. In Django, the Channels library enables developers to easily incorporate websockets into their projects. However, it's important to handle disconnections and errors to ensure a robust and reliable websocket implementation.

## Detecting Disconnections

When a websocket connection is closed unexpectedly, Django Channels provides a mechanism to detect the disconnect event and perform necessary actions. This is done through the `disconnect` method defined in the consumer class.

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import WebsocketConsumer

class MyConsumer(WebsocketConsumer):
    def connect(self):
        # Connect logic

    def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Disconnect logic
```

In the `disconnect` method, you can implement custom logic to handle the disconnection event. For example, you might want to unsubscribe the user from any specific websocket channels they were subscribed to or update their status in the database.

## Handling Errors

In addition to disconnections, it's also crucial to handle errors that can occur during the websocket connection. Django Channels provides an `error` method to handle such errors.

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import WebsocketConsumer

class MyConsumer(WebsocketConsumer):
    def connect(self):
        # Connect logic

    def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Disconnect logic

    def error(self, error_message):
        # Error handling logic
```

Within the `error` method, you can define how to handle different types of errors, such as logging the error, notifying the client, or gracefully recovering from the error. 

## Conclusion

By implementing proper handling of disconnects and errors in Django websockets, you can enhance the reliability and robustness of your web application. Detecting and handling disconnections allows you to perform necessary clean-up tasks, while error handling helps in effectively managing unexpected errors to provide a seamless user experience.
