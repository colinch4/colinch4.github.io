In this blog post, we will explore how to build a real-time job matching platform using websockets in Django. The platform will allow employers to post job listings, and job seekers to receive instant notifications when a relevant job is posted.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Django
- Channels
- Redis

## Setting up the Project

First, let's create a new Django project:

```python
python manage.py startproject job_matching_platform
```

Next, create a new Django app within the project:

```python
python manage.py startapp job_matching
```

Now, let's install Channels and Redis using pip:

```python
pip install channels
pip install channels_redis
```

## Setting up Websockets using Channels

To enable websockets functionality in our Django project, follow these steps:

1. In the `settings.py` file, add `'channels'` and `'channels_redis'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
2. Add the following lines to the bottom of the `settings.py` file to configure Channels and Redis:

```python
ASGI_APPLICATION = 'job_matching_platform.asgi.application'

CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
        'CONFIG': {
            'hosts': [('localhost', 6379)],
        },
    },
}
```

3. Create a new file called `asgi.py` in the project's root directory with the following content:

```python
import os
from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from job_matching.routing import websocket_urlpatterns

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'job_matching_platform.settings')

application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
    'http': get_asgi_application(),
    'websocket': URLRouter(websocket_urlpatterns),
})
```

4. Create a new file called `routing.py` in the `job_matching` app directory with the following content:

```python
from job_matching.consumers import JobConsumer
from django.urls import re_path

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'ws/job_matching/$', JobConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

5. Create a new file called `consumers.py` in the `job_matching` app directory with the following content:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class JobConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        pass
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to set up websockets in a Django project using Channels and Redis. We have also created the basic structure for a real-time job matching platform. This serves as a starting point for building more advanced features, such as job recommendation algorithms and chat functionality.

Now that you have the foundation in place, you can explore more features and customize the platform to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding!
