In this tech blog post, we will explore how to build a real-time cryptocurrency trading bot using websockets in Django. Cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and can be highly volatile, making real-time data crucial for successful trading strategies. Websockets provide a fast and efficient way to receive real-time data updates and interact with cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Basic knowledge of Django and Python
- A development environment set up with Django installed
- An account with a cryptocurrency exchange that provides a websocket API (we will use Binance as an example)

## Setting up the Django Project

1. Create a new Django project by running the following command:
```bash
django-admin startproject crypto_bot
```
2. Create a new Django app within the project:
```bash
cd crypto_bot
python manage.py startapp trading_bot
```

## Installing Dependencies

To interact with websockets and cryptocurrency exchanges, we will need to install the necessary dependencies. Let's update the `requirements.txt` file with the following packages:

```plaintext
asgiref==3.4.1
Django==3.2.8
websocket-client==1.2.1
```

Install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuring the Cryptocurrency Exchange API

1. Obtain API keys from your chosen cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., Binance).
2. Create a `config.py` file in the root of the Django project and add your API keys:
```python
API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'
```

## Creating the WebSocket Client

In the `trading_bot` app, create a new file called `websocket_client.py`. This file will contain the logic for connecting to the exchange's websocket API and receiving real-time data updates.

```python
import websocket
import json
from trading_bot.config import API_KEY, SECRET_KEY

class WebSocketClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ws = None

    def connect(self):
        url = 'wss://api.binance.com/ws'
        self.ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(url,
                                         on_message=self.on_message,
                                         on_close=self.on_close,
                                         on_error=self.on_error)
        self.ws.run_forever()

    def on_message(self, ws, message):
        data = json.loads(message)
        # Handle real-time data updates

    def on_close(self, ws):
        # Handle websocket connection closed

    def on_error(self, ws, error):
        # Handle errors

```

## Integrating with Django

To integrate the websocket client into Django, we will create a Django management command that will be used to start the bot. In the `trading_bot/management/commands` directory, create a new file named `start_trading_bot.py`. This file will contain the logic to run the websocket client.

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from trading_bot.websocket_client import WebSocketClient

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        websocket_client = WebSocketClient()
        websocket_client.connect()
```

To start the trading bot, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py start_trading_bot
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have seen how to implement a real-time cryptocurrency trading bot using websockets in Django. We created a websocket client to connect to the exchange's websocket API and receive real-time data updates. By integrating this with Django, we can easily manage and run the trading bot within a Django project. This is just a starting point, and you can customize the trading bot based on your own trading strategies and requirements.
