To get started, we need to install Django Channels, an extension to Django that supports websockets. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install channels
```

Once installed, we need to configure Django to use Channels. Add `'channels'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your project's `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'channels',
    ...
]
```

Next, we need to create a new file called `routing.py` in your Django project's directory. In this file, we will define the websocket routes for our application:

```python
from django.urls import re_path

from . import consumers

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'ws/feed/$', consumers.FeedConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

This sets up a websocket route at `/ws/feed/` that will be handled by the `FeedConsumer` class in the `consumers.py` module.

Now, let's create the `consumers.py` module. In this module, we will define the logic for handling the websocket connections and managing the real-time feed:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class FeedConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        # Code to connect to the WebSocket
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Code to disconnect from the WebSocket
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        # Code to receive data from the WebSocket
        pass

    async def update_feed(self, event):
        # Code to send updated feed data to the WebSocket
        pass
```

In the `FeedConsumer` class, we define several methods. The `connect` method is called when a WebSocket connection is established. The `disconnect` method is called when the connection is closed. The `receive` method is called when data is received from the WebSocket. Finally, the `update_feed` method is responsible for sending updated feed data to the WebSocket.

To broadcast the updated feed data to all connected clients, we can utilize Django's built-in `ChannelLayer`:

```python
from channels.layers import get_channel_layer
from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync

channel_layer = get_channel_layer()

async def update_feed_data():
    await channel_layer.group_send(
        'feed_group',
        {
            'type': 'update_feed',
            'content': 'New feed data',
        }
    )
```

In the above code, we get the `ChannelLayer` and use the `group_send` method to send the updated feed data to a group of connected clients. We define the `group_send` handler in the `FeedConsumer` class.

To connect the websockets to your Django views, add the following code to your project's `urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('feed/', views.FeedView.as_view(), name='feed'),
    ...
]
```

In the `views.py` module, we can create a view that renders the HTML template containing the WebSocket connection:

```python
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class FeedView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'feed.html'
```

Lastly, in your HTML template file, you can create a WebSocket connection using JavaScript:

```html
<script>
    var socket = new WebSocket("ws://" + window.location.host + "/ws/feed/");

    socket.onmessage = function(e) {
        // Code to handle received data from WebSocket
    }
</script>
```

With this setup, you have a real-time social networking feed. As new content is added or updated, it will be instantly reflected in the connected clients' feeds.

So there you have it! With Django Channels, implementing a real-time social networking feed with websockets becomes a breeze. Have fun exploring this powerful tool and creating interactive web applications.
