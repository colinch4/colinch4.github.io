In this tutorial, we will learn how to convert GPS data to an SQLite database using Python. Storing GPS data in a database can be useful for further analysis, visualization, or integration into other systems.

To get started, let's assume we have GPS data in a file called `gps_data.csv` with columns `latitude`, `longitude`, and `timestamp`. We will use the `pandas` library to read the CSV file and `sqlite3` module to interact with the SQLite database.

First, let's import the necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
```

Next, let's read the GPS data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
data = pd.read_csv('gps_data.csv')
```

Now, let's create a SQLite database connection and a table to store the GPS data:

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('gps_data.db')
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE gps_data
             (latitude real, longitude real, timestamp text)''')
```

We defined a table named `gps_data` with columns `latitude` (real), `longitude` (real), and `timestamp` (text).

Next, let's insert the GPS data into the SQLite database:

```python
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    c.execute("INSERT INTO gps_data VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
              (row['latitude'], row['longitude'], row['timestamp']))
```

Finally, let's commit the changes and close the database connection:

```python
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

That's it! Now you have successfully converted GPS data to an SQLite database using Python.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to convert GPS data to an SQLite database using Python. Storing GPS data in a database allows for more advanced analysis, visualization, and integration with other systems. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily convert your GPS data into an SQLite database for further use.
