In today's fast-paced online marketplaces, providing real-time order tracking to customers is essential. One way to achieve this is by using websockets, which allow for bidirectional communication between the server and client in real-time. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time order tracking using websockets in a Django application.

## What are Websockets?

Websockets are a protocol that allows for full-duplex communication between a client and server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, where the client initiates a request and the server responds, websockets allow for both the client and server to send messages to each other at any time.

## Getting Started

To implement websocket functionality in Django, we'll need to use a library called `django-channels`. This library provides the infrastructure to handle websockets and integrates seamlessly with Django projects.

### 1. Install Django Channels

To install `django-channels`, use the following command:

```
pip install channels
```

### 2. Configure Django Channels

In your Django project, add `'channels'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in the settings.py file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'channels',
    ...
]
```

Also, add a new setting called `ASGI_APPLICATION` pointing to a new `routing.py` file:

```python
ASGI_APPLICATION = 'myproject.routing.application'
```

### 3. Create a Websocket Consumer

A consumer is a class that handles incoming websocket connections and manages the communication between the server and the client. Create a new file called `consumers.py` and define a websocket consumer class:

```python
import asyncio
import json
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class OrderConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        data = json.loads(text_data)
        # process the received data
        
        # send a response
        await self.send(json.dumps(response_data))
```

### 4. Create a Websocket URL Routing

Create a new file called `routing.py` and define the routing configuration for websockets:

```python
from django.urls import re_path
from .consumers import OrderConsumer

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'ws/order-tracking/(?P<order_id>\d+)/$', OrderConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

### 5. Modify Django URL Configuration

In your project's `urls.py` file, add the websocket URL routing:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('ws/', include('myproject.routing.websocket_urlpatterns')),
    ...
]
```

### 6. Frontend Integration

Integrate the websocket functionality into your frontend application using a Javascript library like **Socket.io** or **WebSocket API**. Connect to the websocket URL and send/receive messages as needed.

## Conclusion

With the power of websockets and Django channels, implementing real-time order tracking in your Django application becomes a breeze. Customers can now enjoy a seamless and interactive experience while tracking their orders in real-time. Happy coding!
