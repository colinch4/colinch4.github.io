One common task when working with GPS data is calculating the heading direction or bearing between two consecutive GPS points. This information can be useful in various applications such as navigation systems, location-based services, and robotics.

In Python, we can use the `geopy` library to perform the necessary calculations. `geopy` is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services, including OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and Bing Maps.

To get started, you'll need to install the `geopy` library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install geopy
```

Once you have `geopy` installed, you can use the following code snippet as an example to calculate the heading direction:

```python
from geopy import distance

def calculate_heading(point1, point2):
    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    dist = distance.distance(point1, point2).meters

    # Determine the difference in latitude and longitude
    diff_lat = point2.latitude - point1.latitude
    diff_lon = point2.longitude - point1.longitude

    # Calculate the heading using atan2 function in Python's math module
    heading = math.atan2(diff_lat, diff_lon)

    # Convert the heading from radians to degrees
    heading_deg = math.degrees(heading)

    # Ensure the heading is within 0-360 degrees range
    if heading_deg < 0:
        heading_deg += 360

    return heading_deg

# Example usage
point1 = (42.3601, -71.0589)  # Starting GPS point (latitude, longitude)
point2 = (52.5200, 13.4050)  # Ending GPS point (latitude, longitude)

heading = calculate_heading(point1, point2)
print(f"The heading from point1 to point2 is: {heading} degrees")
```

In this code snippet, we define a function `calculate_heading` that takes two GPS points as input. The `distance.distance()` function is used to calculate the distance between the two points in meters. Then, we calculate the difference in latitude and longitude between the two points and use the `math.atan2()` function to calculate the heading in radians. Next, we convert the heading from radians to degrees using `math.degrees()`. Finally, we ensure that the heading is within the 0-360 degrees range by adding 360 if it is negative.

Keep in mind that this code assumes a flat Earth model and does not account for factors such as elevation or magnetic declination. If you require more accurate results, you may need to employ additional techniques or consider using specialized libraries or APIs.

Remember to import the necessary libraries (`math` and `geopy.distance`) and define the GPS points `point1` and `point2` according to your own data.
