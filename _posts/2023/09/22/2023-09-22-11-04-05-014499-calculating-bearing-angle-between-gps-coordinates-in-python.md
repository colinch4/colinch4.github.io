## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- GeographicLib: `pip install geographiclib`

## Calculating Bearing Angle
To calculate the bearing angle between two GPS coordinates, we can make use of the GeographicLib library in Python. GeographicLib is a powerful geodesic library that includes various geodesic calculations, including bearing angle.

Here's an example code snippet that calculates the bearing angle between two GPS coordinates:

```python
from geographiclib.geodesic import Geodesic

# GPS coordinates of point A
latitude1 = 52.5200  # latitude of point A
longitude1 = 13.4050  # longitude of point A

# GPS coordinates of point B
latitude2 = 51.5074  # latitude of point B
longitude2 = -0.1278  # longitude of point B

# Create a Geodesic object
geod = Geodesic.WGS84

# Calculate the geodesic between the two points
result = geod.Inverse(latitude1, longitude1, latitude2, longitude2)

# Get the bearing angle from the result
bearing_angle = result['azi1']

# Print the bearing angle
print(f"The bearing angle between point A and point B is: {bearing_angle} degrees")
```

In the above code, we first import the `Geodesic` class from the `geographiclib.geodesic` module. We then define the GPS coordinates of point A and point B. Next, we create a `Geodesic` object with the WGS84 datum.

Using the `Inverse` method of the `geod` object, we calculate the geodesic between the two points. The `Inverse` method returns a dictionary containing various values, including the bearing angles `azi1` and `azi2`.

In this example, we retrieve the bearing angle `azi1` using `result['azi1']`. Finally, we print the bearing angle between point A and point B.

## Conclusion
Calculating the bearing angle between GPS coordinates is essential for various applications involving spatial calculations. By using the GeographicLib library in Python, we can easily perform these calculations accurately. Incorporate this code in your projects and leverage the bearing angle to enhance your spatial analysis.
