In today's fast-paced world, users expect real-time updates and interactions in web applications. One area where this is particularly important is in flight booking systems. Users want to see the available flights and prices update dynamically as they browse different options. To achieve this real-time experience, we can make use of **Websockets** in Django.

## What are Websockets?

Websockets are a communication protocol that provides a persistent connection between the client and the server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, where the client initiates a request and the server responds, websockets allow for bidirectional communication. This means that the server can send data to the client without the client explicitly requesting it.

## Django Channels

[Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/) is an extension for Django that enables the use of websockets and other real-time protocols. It allows you to handle websocket connections and manage the flow of real-time data in your Django application.

To get started, you need to install Django Channels:

```shell
pip install channels
```

## Implementing Real-time Flight Booking

Let's dive into an example of using websockets for real-time flight booking in Django. Suppose we have a flight booking application where users can search for flights and see the availability and prices update in real-time.

### 1. Setup Django Channels

First, we need to configure Django Channels in our project. Update your project's `settings.py` file by adding the following:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'channels',
]

ASGI_APPLICATION = 'your_app_name.routing.application'
```

### 2. Define a Websocket Consumer

Create a new file called `consumers.py` in your Django app directory. This file will contain the websocket consumer that handles the real-time flight updates:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer
import json

class FlightConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        # Code to handle websocket connection

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Code to handle websocket disconnection

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        # Code to handle incoming websocket data

    async def send_flight_updates(self, event):
        # Code to send flight updates to the client
```

### 3. Routing

Create a new file called `routing.py` in your Django app directory. This file will define the routing configuration for your websocket connections:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .consumers import FlightConsumer

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    path('ws/flight_updates/', FlightConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

### 4. Update Project's ASGI Application

Add the websocket routing configuration to your project's `asgi.py` file:

```python
from django.urls import get_asgi_application
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from your_app_name.routing import websocket_urlpatterns

application = ProtocolTypeRouter(
    {
        "http": get_asgi_application(),
        "websocket": URLRouter(websocket_urlpatterns),
    }
)
```

### 5. Frontend Integration

On the frontend side, you need to establish a websocket connection from the client to the server and handle the incoming flight updates. You can use JavaScript libraries like [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) or [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) to achieve this.

## Conclusion

By using websockets and Django Channels, we can provide real-time flight updates to our users as they search for flights in our booking application. The combination of Django's powerful backend capabilities and Channels' websocket support allows us to create seamless and interactive user experiences.
