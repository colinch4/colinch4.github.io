In this blog post, we will explore how to use websockets to provide real-time flight delay updates in a Django application. Websockets allow for bidirectional communication between the client and the server, making it a perfect fit for real-time applications.

## What are Websockets?

Websockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are stateless and require a new connection for every request, websockets allow for continuous communication between the client and the server.

## Setting up Django Channels

To use websockets in Django, we need to install and configure [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a third-party package that adds websocket support to Django.

```python
pip install channels
```

Once installed, we need to include Channels in our project's settings. Open the `settings.py` file and add `'channels'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps...
    'channels',
]
```

Next, we need to update the project's URL configuration to include Channels routing. Create a new file `routing.py` in your project's root directory and define the routing configuration:

```python
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from django.urls import path
from myapp.consumers import FlightDelayConsumer

application = ProtocolTypeRouter(
    {
        "http": get_asgi_application(),
        "websocket": AuthMiddlewareStack(
            URLRouter([
                path("ws/flight-delay/", FlightDelayConsumer.as_asgi()),
            ])
        ),
    }
)
```

This configuration includes a sample WebSocket route for handling flight delay updates. Adjust the route and consumer class according to your application's needs.

## Implementing the FlightDelayConsumer

The `FlightDelayConsumer` is responsible for handling websocket connections, receiving updates, and broadcasting them to connected clients. Create a new file `consumers.py` in your app directory:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class FlightDelayConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        # Handle incoming flight delay update, e.g., retrieve data from API
        # Broadcast the update to all connected clients
        await self.send(text_data)
```

The `connect` method is called when a client connects to the websocket. In this example, we simply accept the connection. The `disconnect` method is called when a client disconnects, and the `receive` method is called when the server receives data from the client. You can customize these methods to suit your needs.

## Broadcasting Flight Delay Updates

To broadcast flight delay updates to connected clients, we can use the `Group` feature provided by Django Channels. Modify the `FlightDelayConsumer` class as follows:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer, AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer
from channels.db import database_sync_to_async
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

class FlightDelayConsumer(AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        user = self.scope["user"]
        if user.is_anonymous:
            await self.close()
        else:
            await self.channel_layer.group_add(
                "flight-delay",
                self.channel_name
            )
            await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        await self.channel_layer.group_discard(
            "flight-delay",
            self.channel_name
        )

    async def receive_json(self, content):
        # Handle incoming flight delay update, e.g., retrieve data from API
        # Broadcast the update to all connected clients
        await self.channel_layer.group_send(
            "flight-delay",
            {
                "type": "flight.delay",
                "data": content
            }
        )

    async def flight_delay(self, event):
        await self.send_json(event["data"])
```

In this updated version, we have added authentication checks to ensure that only logged-in users can connect to the websocket. We have also implemented the `receive_json` method to handle incoming data in JSON format, and the `flight_delay` method to handle broadcasting updates to all connected clients.

## Conclusion

By using websockets and Django Channels, we can provide real-time flight delay updates to our users. With websockets, the need for continuous polling of the server is eliminated, resulting in a more efficient and responsive application.
