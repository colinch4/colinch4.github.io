To get started, we first need to install the Goose library. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install goose3
```

Once the library is installed, we can begin extracting specific elements from articles. Let's say we have a web page with an article and we are interested in extracting the title, text, and images from that article. Here's how we can do it using Python Goose:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

# Create a Goose object
g = Goose()

# Specify the URL of the web page
url = '<URL of the web page>'

# Extract the article content
article = g.extract(url)

# Extract the title of the article
title = article.title

# Extract the main text of the article
text = article.cleaned_text

# Extract the images from the article
images = article.top_image.src

# Print the extracted information
print("Title: ", title)
print("Text: ", text)
print("Images: ", images)
```

In the above code, we import the `Goose` class from the `goose3` module. We create a `Goose` object and specify the URL of the web page we want to extract the article from. We then use the `extract` method to extract the article content. We can access different attributes of the `article` object, such as `title`, `cleaned_text`, and `top_image.src`, to get the desired information.

By using the above code snippet, we can easily extract specific elements from articles using Python Goose. It provides a convenient way to retrieve only the relevant information we need, making it a valuable tool in web scraping and content extraction tasks.
