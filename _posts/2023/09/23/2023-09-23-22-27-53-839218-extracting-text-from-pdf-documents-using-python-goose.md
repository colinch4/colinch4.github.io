In this tech blog post, we will explore how to extract text from PDF documents using Python Goose. PDF files are commonly used for sharing documents, and being able to extract the text from these files programmatically can be very useful in various applications.

## What is Python Goose?

Python Goose is a powerful library for extracting content, metadata, and other structured data from websites. It supports various document formats, including PDF files, making it a great tool for extracting text from PDF documents.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install Python Goose. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
pip install goose3
```

## Extracting Text from PDF Documents

Once you have Python Goose installed, you can start extracting text from PDF documents. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
import goose3

def extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):
    g = goose3.Goose()

    # Load the PDF file
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        pdf_content = file.read()

    # Extract the text using Python Goose
    extracted_text = g.extract(raw_html=pdf_content)

    return extracted_text.cleaned_text

# Usage example
pdf_file_path = 'path_to_your_pdf_file.pdf'
text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file_path)
print(text)
```

In the above code, we first import the `goose3` library. Then, we define a function `extract_text_from_pdf` that takes the file path of the PDF document as input.

Inside the function, we create an instance of the `Goose` class and load the PDF file using the `open` function. We then pass the raw HTML content of the PDF file to the `extract` method of the `Goose` instance, which returns an object containing the extracted text.

Finally, we return the cleaned text by accessing the `cleaned_text` attribute of the extracted text object.

## Conclusion

Extracting text from PDF documents using Python Goose can be a handy tool in various applications, from data extraction to document analysis. With its simplicity and powerful features, Python Goose makes it easy to extract text from PDF files programmatically.
