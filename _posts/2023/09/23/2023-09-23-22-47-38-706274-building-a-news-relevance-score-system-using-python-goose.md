In today's fast-paced world, staying updated with the latest news is crucial. However, with the overwhelming amount of information available, it can be challenging to determine the relevance and credibility of news articles. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a news relevance score system using Python and the Goose library.

## What is Goose?

Goose is a Python library that allows us to extract relevant information from web pages. It uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract the main content, title, meta data, and other relevant information from news articles.

## Setting up the Environment

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the Goose library using pip:

```
pip install goose3
```

## Extracting Relevant Information

To extract information from a news article, we first need to create a Goose extractor object. Here's an example:

```python
import goose3

url = "https://www.example.com/news-article"
extractor = goose3.Goose()
article = extractor.extract(url)
```

In the above code, we create an extractor object and pass in the URL of the news article we want to extract information from. The `extract()` method then fetches the article from the web and processes it.

## Retrieving Relevant Information

Once we have the article object, we can retrieve various useful properties such as title, meta description, and main text content. Here's an example:

```python
title = article.title
meta_description = article.meta_description
main_text = article.cleaned_text
```

The `title` property gives us the title of the article, the `meta_description` property gives us the meta description if available, and the `cleaned_text` property provides the main text content stripped of any HTML tags or noise.

## Scoring the Relevance

To determine the relevance of a news article, we can utilize various factors such as the presence of keywords, the length of the article, and the reputation of the news source. Here's an example of how we can calculate a relevance score:

```python
keyword = "Python"
score = 0

# Check if keyword is present in the title or main text
if keyword.lower() in title.lower() or keyword.lower() in main_text.lower():
    score += 1

# Add score based on article length
score += len(main_text.split()) / 500

# Add additional score for reputable news sources

# Calculate the final relevance score
relevance_score = score / 3
```

In the above code, we start with an initial score of 0 and increment it based on the presence of a keyword in the title or main text. We also add a score based on the length of the article. Additional factors such as the reputation of the news source can also be considered to determine the final relevance score.

## Conclusion

Building a news relevance score system using Python and the Goose library can help you filter and prioritize news articles based on their importance and credibility. By extracting relevant information from articles and scoring their relevance, you can stay updated with the news that matters most to you.
