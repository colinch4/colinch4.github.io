In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of parallel and redundant robotic systems across various industries. These systems offer improved performance, flexibility, and fault tolerance in tasks such as manufacturing, assembly, and automation.

Python, being a versatile and powerful programming language, provides excellent support for controlling and managing parallel and redundant robotic systems. In this blog post, we will explore how Python can be used to effectively control such systems.

## Modeling Parallel and Redundant Robotic Systems

Before diving into the control aspect, it is crucial to understand how parallel and redundant robotic systems are modeled. These systems consist of multiple robotic arms, each with its own set of joints and end-effectors. The configuration space of such a system is high-dimensional, making it challenging to control.

To model these systems, a combination of forward and inverse kinematics equations is used. Forward kinematics calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector(s) given the joint angles, while inverse kinematics solves for the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.

## Implementing Control Algorithms in Python

Python provides several libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged to implement control algorithms for parallel and redundant robotic systems. One such popular library is **Robotics Toolbox for Python (RTB)**, which provides a wide range of tools for robot kinematics, dynamics, and control.

Using RTB, you can define the kinematic and dynamic properties of each robot arm in the system. It allows you to calculate forward and inverse kinematics, perform trajectory planning, and implement motion control algorithms such as joint space and operational space control.

Additionally, you can utilize other Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **Matplotlib** for numerical computations, optimization, and visualization, respectively. These libraries can enhance the capabilities of your control algorithms and provide a more efficient and intuitive way to analyze and visualize the behavior of the robotic systems.

## Example Code: Joint Space Control of Parallel Robotic System

```python
import numpy as np
from roboticstoolbox import robot

# Define the robotic system using RTB
rob1 = robot.DHRobot([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], 'standard')
rob2 = robot.DHRobot([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], 'standard')

# Set desired end-effector position for each arm
desired_pos1 = np.array([1, 1, 1])
desired_pos2 = np.array([-1, -1, -1])

# Calculate joint angles using inverse kinematics
joint_angles1 = rob1.ikine(desired_pos1)
joint_angles2 = rob2.ikine(desired_pos2)

# Set joint angle targets and control gains
target_angles1 = joint_angles1
target_angles2 = joint_angles2
Kp = 1.0  # Proportional gain
Kd = 0.1  # Derivative gain

# Loop until desired positions are reached
while not np.allclose(rob1.fkine(rob1.q), desired_pos1) or not np.allclose(rob2.fkine(rob2.q), desired_pos2):
    # Calculate the control error
    error1 = target_angles1 - rob1.q
    error2 = target_angles2 - rob2.q

    # Calculate joint velocity using PD control
    joint_velocities1 = Kp * error1 + Kd * rob1.qd
    joint_velocities2 = Kp * error2 + Kd * rob2.qd

    # Apply joint velocities to the robotic system
    rob1.qd = joint_velocities1
    rob2.qd = joint_velocities2
    
    # Perform a small integration time step
    rob1.q += rob1.qd * dt
    rob2.q += rob2.qd * dt

    # Update the robot's graphical representation (visualization)
    rob1.plot(robot=True)
    rob2.plot(robot=True)
```

## Conclusion

Python provides a powerful environment for controlling and managing parallel and redundant robotic systems. Libraries such as RTB, along with other numerically-oriented libraries, enable the implementation of control algorithms with ease. By leveraging these tools, you can effectively control and automate complex robotic systems, enhancing their performance and flexibility.
