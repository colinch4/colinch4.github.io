In the world of web scraping, extracting images and multimedia content from articles can be a useful task for various applications, such as building an image gallery or creating a multimedia content aggregator. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using the Python library called Goose.

Goose is a powerful and easy-to-use library for extracting content, including images, from web pages. It utilizes the DOM tree structure of HTML documents to identify and retrieve relevant information. Here's how you can use Goose to extract images and multimedia content from articles.

## Installation

First, let's install the Goose library using pip:

```plaintext
pip install goose3
```

## Extracting Images

To extract images from an article, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
from goose3 import Goose
import requests
```

2. Load the article using the Goose library:
```python
article_url = "https://example.com/article"
g = Goose()
article = g.extract(url=article_url)
```

3. Retrieve the image URLs from the article object:
```python
image_urls = article.top_image.src
```

4. Download the images using the requests library:
```python
for i, url in enumerate(image_urls):
    response = requests.get(url)
    file_name = f"image_{i}.jpg"
    with open(file_name, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
```

By following these steps, you will be able to extract and download the images from the specified article URL.

## Extracting Multimedia Content

Similarly, Goose can be used to extract multimedia content such as videos from articles. Here's how you can accomplish that:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
from goose3 import Goose
import requests
```

2. Load the article using the Goose library:
```python
article_url = "https://example.com/article"
g = Goose()
article = g.extract(url=article_url)
```

3. Retrieve the multimedia URLs from the article object:
```python
multimedia_urls = article.movies
```

4. Download the multimedia content using the requests library:
```python
for i, url in enumerate(multimedia_urls):
    response = requests.get(url)
    file_name = f"multimedia_{i}.mp4"
    with open(file_name, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
```

By following these steps, you will be able to extract and download the multimedia content from the specified article URL.

## Conclusion

Extracting images and multimedia content from articles can be a valuable task for various applications. With Python Goose library, you can easily extract images and multimedia URLs from web pages and download them for further use.
