In today's digital age, there is a high demand for audio content. Many people prefer listening to articles and blog posts rather than reading them. With the help of text-to-speech (TTS) technology, it is now possible to convert written articles into spoken audio. In this blog post, we will explore how to extract articles from websites using Python and the Goose library, which is a powerful tool for web scraping.

# What is Goose?

Goose is a Python library specifically designed for extracting article content from websites. It is capable of parsing HTML and extracting the main body of an article, removing any clutter or irrelevant content. Goose also takes care of cleaning up the extracted text, making it ideal for use with TTS applications.

# Installation

To get started with Goose, you need to install it using pip, which is the Python package installer. Open your command-line interface and enter the following command:

```
pip install goose3
```

This will install the Goose library and its dependencies. Now you are ready to start extracting articles for text-to-speech conversion.

# Extracting Articles with Goose

To extract articles from a website using Goose, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
from goose3 import Goose
```

2. Create an instance of the Goose class:
```python
g = Goose()
```

3. Use the `extract` method to extract the article content from a given URL:
```python
article = g.extract(url='https://www.example.com/article')
```

4. Access the article content through the `cleaned_text` attribute:
```python
text = article.cleaned_text
```

# Example Usage

Let's take a look at a practical example. Suppose we want to extract an article from the TechCrunch website and convert it into audio. We can use the following code:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

# Create an instance of the Goose class
g = Goose()

# Extract the article from the given URL
url = 'https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/introducing-goose-convert-doc-string-to-a-blog-post-in-seconds/'
article = g.extract(url=url)

# Access the cleaned text content
text = article.cleaned_text

# Print the extracted article
print(text)
```

In this example, we extract the article from a specific URL and print the cleaned text content. You can then pass this text to a text-to-speech engine to generate the audio.

# Conclusion

With the help of the Goose library in Python, you can easily extract articles from websites for text-to-speech conversion. This allows you to consume written content in audio format, providing an alternative way to access information. Whether you're a visually impaired person, someone who prefers audio content, or simply want to listen to articles while on the go, the combination of Goose and TTS technology can offer a valuable solution. Give it a try and explore the possibilities!
