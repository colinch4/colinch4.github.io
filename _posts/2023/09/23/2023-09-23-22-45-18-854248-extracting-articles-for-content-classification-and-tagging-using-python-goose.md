In the field of natural language processing and data analysis, classifying and tagging articles is a common task. It involves extracting the main content of an article and assigning relevant tags or categories to it. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using Python and the Goose library.

## What is Goose?

Goose is a Python library specifically designed for web content extraction. It uses machine learning algorithms to identify and extract the main textual content from web pages. It eliminates noise, advertising, and other unrelated elements, and focuses solely on the article's text.

## Installation

To install Goose, you can use pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install goose3
```

## Extracting Article Content

Once you have Goose installed, you can start extracting content from a given URL. Here's an example code snippet to help you get started:

```python
import goose3

url = "https://example.com/article"

# Create a Goose extractor
extractor = goose3.Goose()

# Extract the article
article = extractor.extract(url)

# Get the article content
content = article.cleaned_text

print(content)
```

In the above code, we begin by importing the `goose3` module. Then, we define the URL of the article we want to extract. After that, we create a "Goose" object, which will be used for extracting the content. We pass the URL to the `extract()` function, which returns an `Article` object. Finally, we access the `cleaned_text` property of the `Article` object to retrieve the extracted content.

## Classifying and Tagging Articles

Once we have extracted the article content, we can proceed with classifying and tagging it. There are several approaches to achieve this, such as using machine learning models or predefined categories.

For the purpose of this blog post, we will use a simple example using predefined categories. Let's assume we have a list of categories and keywords associated with each category. We can compare the extracted content against these keywords to determine the appropriate category.

Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate this:

```python
categories = {
    "technology": ["tech", "innovation", "software"],
    "sports": ["football", "basketball", "tennis"],
    "health": ["wellness", "fitness", "nutrition"]
}

# Classify the article
def classify_article(content):
    for category, keywords in categories.items():
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword in content:
                return category
    return "unknown"

# Example usage
category = classify_article(content)
print(f"The article belongs to the {category} category.")
```

In the above code, we have predefined categories with their associated keywords. The `classify_article()` function iterates over the categories and keywords, and checks if any of the keywords are present in the extracted content. If a match is found, the function returns the corresponding category. If no match is found, it returns "unknown".

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to extract article content using Python Goose and how to classify and tag the extracted content based on predefined categories. Goose provides a simple yet powerful approach to scrape and extract articles from web pages, while the classification step allows us to assign relevant tags or categories for further analysis.
