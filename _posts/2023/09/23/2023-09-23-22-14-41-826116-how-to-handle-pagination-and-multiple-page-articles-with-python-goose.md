When scraping websites for article content, you may encounter situations where articles are split into multiple pages for easier reading or to incorporate ads and other elements. In such cases, it's important to handle pagination to ensure that you scrape all the pages and retrieve the complete article content.

## Python Goose
Goose is a Python library that specializes in extracting article content from webpages. It has built-in functionality to handle pagination and extract full articles spread across multiple pages.

## Pagination handling using Goose

To handle pagination using Goose, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Goose library using pip:

```bash
pip install goose3
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from goose3 import Goose
```

3. Create an instance of the Goose object:

```python
g = Goose()
```

4. Fetch the HTML content of the first page using your preferred method (e.g., requests library):

```python
import requests

url = 'https://website.com/article'
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.text
```

5. Pass the HTML content to Goose and extract the article object:

```python
article = g.extract(raw_html=html_content)
```

6. Check if the article has multiple pages:

```python
if article.has_additional_pages:
    additional_pages = article.additional_pages
    for page_url in additional_pages:
        response = requests.get(page_url)
        page_content = response.text
        page_article = g.extract(raw_html=page_content)

        # Process the additional page article content
        # (e.g., append it to the main article content)
```

7. Finally, access the complete article content:

```python
complete_article_content = article.cleaned_text
```

8. You can now process the complete article content as needed.

## Conclusion

Using Python Goose, handling pagination and extracting article content spread across multiple pages becomes straightforward. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily scrape and retrieve complete articles, even if they are paginated. Remember to respect website scraping policies and be mindful of the frequency and volume of your requests.
