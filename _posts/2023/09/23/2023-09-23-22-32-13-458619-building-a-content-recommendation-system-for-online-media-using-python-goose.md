In today's digital age, online media platforms are flooded with an abundance of content. With so much content available, users often struggle to find articles or news that are relevant to their interests. This is where a content recommendation system comes into play. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a content recommendation system using Python Goose.

## What is Python Goose?

Python Goose is a web scraping library that specializes in extracting article content from online web pages. It can crawl web pages, extract HTML data, and retrieve the main text of articles, making it an ideal tool for building a content recommendation system.

## Steps to Build a Content Recommendation System

### Step 1: Collect Article Data

To build a content recommendation system, we need a dataset of articles as a starting point. Python Goose can be used to crawl popular online media websites and extract article information such as title, text, and keywords. We can then store this data in a structured format, such as a CSV file or a database.

```python
import goose3

def extract_article(url):
    g = goose3.Goose()
    article = g.extract(url=url)
    return {
        'title': article.title,
        'text': article.cleaned_text,
        'keywords': article.meta_keywords.split(',')
    }
```

### Step 2: Preprocessing

Once we have the article data, we need to preprocess it before building our recommendation system. Preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the raw text data so that it is suitable for analysis. This can include removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words.

```python
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove punctuation
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    filtered_text = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(filtered_text)
```

### Step 3: Content Similarity

To recommend articles to users, we need to measure the similarity between articles. One way to achieve this is by using a vector space model, such as TF-IDF. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) assigns weights to words based on their importance in a document corpus. We can use the *scikit-learn* library to calculate the TF-IDF matrix.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def compute_similarity(article_texts):
    # Create TF-IDF matrix
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(article_texts)
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity matrix
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
    return similarity_matrix
```

### Step 4: Recommendation

With the similarity matrix in hand, we can now recommend articles to users. Given a selected article, we can find the most similar articles based on their cosine similarity scores. We can then recommend these similar articles to the user.

```python
def make_recommendation(article_index, similarity_matrix, num_recommendations=5):
    similarity_scores = similarity_matrix[article_index]
    # Get indices of top similar articles
    top_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[::-1][1:num_recommendations+1]
    return top_indices
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to build a content recommendation system for online media using Python Goose. By collecting article data, preprocessing the text, calculating content similarity, and making recommendations, we can help users discover relevant content based on their interests. Building a recommendation system can greatly enhance user experience and increase engagement on online media platforms.
