In today's digital age, where information is readily available on the internet, plagiarism has become a significant concern for academics, researchers, and content creators. To tackle this issue, one approach is to use article extraction tools to gather the content from various sources and compare them for similarities. In this blog post, we will explore how to extract articles using Python Goose and use the extracted content for plagiarism detection.

## What is Python Goose?

Python Goose is a Python library that allows us to extract articles and their metadata from websites. It utilizes a set of heuristics to determine the main content of a webpage and provides a clean and structured representation of the extracted article. This library is widely used for web scraping projects, content analysis, and text mining applications.

## Installing Python Goose

To install Python Goose, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install goose3
```

## Extracting Articles with Python Goose

Once you have installed Python Goose, you can start extracting articles from websites. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to extract an article using Python Goose:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

# Instantiate a Goose object
g = Goose()

# Extract article from a URL
article_url = 'https://www.example.com/article'
article = g.extract(url=article_url)

# Access the extracted article content
article_title = article.title
article_text = article.cleaned_text

# Print the extracted content
print("Title:", article_title)
print("Text:", article_text)
```

In the code snippet above, we first import the Goose class from the goose3 library. We then create an instance of the Goose class and use the `extract()` method to extract the article from a given URL. Finally, we can access different attributes of the extracted article, such as the title and the cleaned text.

## Using Extracted Articles for Plagiarism Detection

Once we have extracted articles using Python Goose, we can utilize the extracted content to perform plagiarism detection. Depending on the specific requirements and techniques you wish to employ, you can compare the extracted articles against each other or check them against a database of existing articles.

To implement plagiarism detection, you can use several approaches, such as comparing the text similarity using techniques like cosine similarity or using algorithms like the Levenshtein distance. Additionally, you can also employ natural language processing techniques to identify similarities in the extracted content.

## Conclusion

Python Goose provides a convenient way to extract articles from websites, enabling us to gather content for plagiarism detection and other text analysis purposes. By utilizing the extracted articles, we can identify similarities and potential instances of plagiarism.
