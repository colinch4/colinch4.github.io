## Installation

First, let's start by installing Python Goose. You can use pip to install the library:

```shell
pip install python-goose
```
## Usage

Once installed, you can import the library and initialize the `Goose` object:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

# Initialize Goose object
g = Goose()

# Define the URL of the web page you want to extract content from
url = "https://example.com/webpage"

# Fetch the article content
article = g.extract(url=url)

# Print the title and article text
print("Title:", article.title)
print("Article:", article.cleaned_text)
```

The `Goose` object provides methods to fetch and extract content from web pages. In the example above, we initialized the `Goose` object and provided the URL of the web page we want to extract content from. The `extract` method is then called on the `Goose` object, passing the URL as a parameter. The `extract` method returns an `Article` object.

We can then access various attributes of the `Article` object, such as the title and the cleaned text of the article. In the example above, we print the title and article text.

## Summary

Python Goose is a powerful library for parsing and extracting content from web pages. It provides an easy-to-use interface to fetch and process articles. Whether you are building a web scraping tool or need to extract article content for analysis, Python Goose is a valuable library to have in your toolkit.
