In web development and data extraction tasks, it is often necessary to parse HTML and CSS to extract specific information or manipulate the content. Python offers a variety of libraries that can help with this task, one of which is Goose.

Goose is a Python library that can be used for HTML and CSS parsing. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for extracting relevant data from web pages.

## Installation

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure we have Goose installed. You can install Goose using `pip` by running the following command:

```python
pip install goose3
```

### Parsing HTML with Goose

To parse HTML using Goose, we first need to import the library and create an instance of the `Goose` class. We then pass the HTML content to the `extract` method and retrieve the parsed data.

```python
from goose3 import Goose

html = "<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body></html>"

g = Goose()
article = g.extract(raw_html=html)

title = article.title
text = article.cleaned_text

print(f"Title: {title}")
print(f"Text: {text}")
```

In the above example, we pass the HTML content to the `extract` method of the `Goose` instance. We can then access the parsed data using properties like `title` and `cleaned_text`. These properties provide the extracted information from the HTML content.

### Parsing CSS with Goose

Goose also provides functionality for parsing CSS. We can extract CSS rules and manipulate them if needed. Here's an example:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

css = "body {font-size: 16px; color: #333;}"

g = Goose()
stylesheet = g.extract_css(css)

rules = stylesheet.rules

for rule in rules:
    selector = rule.selector
    properties = rule.properties
    print(f"Selector: {selector}")
    print(f"Properties: {properties}")
```

In the above code, we pass the CSS content to the `extract_css` method of the `Goose` instance. We then iterate over the extracted `rules`, accessing properties like `selector` (e.g., the CSS selector) and `properties` (e.g., the rule's properties) to perform further operations.

## Conclusion

Parsing HTML and CSS is a common requirement in web development and data extraction tasks. By using the Goose library in Python, we can easily parse and extract relevant data from HTML and CSS content. With its intuitive interface and features, Goose simplifies the process of parsing and manipulating web page content. Give it a try in your next web scraping or data extraction project!
