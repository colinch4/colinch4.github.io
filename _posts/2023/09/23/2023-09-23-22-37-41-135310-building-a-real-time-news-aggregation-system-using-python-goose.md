In today's fast-paced world, staying updated with the latest news is crucial. However, visiting multiple news websites can be time-consuming and overwhelming. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a real-time news aggregation system using Python and the Goose library.

## What is Goose?

Goose is a Python library that allows us to extract useful data from webpages, specifically news articles. It uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to parse HTML and extract relevant information such as the article title, author, publish date, and main content.

## Setting up the Environment

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official website. Once Python is set up, we can proceed to install the Goose library by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install goose3
```

## Gathering News Feeds

The first step in building our real-time news aggregation system is to gather news feeds from various sources. We can leverage RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds provided by popular news websites. With RSS feeds, we can access the latest articles published on these websites.

To obtain the RSS feed URLs for the desired news sources, we can visit their websites and look for links or buttons that say "RSS" or "Subscribe." Once you have the RSS feed URLs, you can store them in a configuration file or database.

## Parsing and Extracting News Articles

Using the Goose library, we can now parse and extract news articles from the gathered RSS feeds. Let's take a look at a code example:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

def parse_news_article(url):
    g = Goose({'enable_image_fetching': False})
    article = g.extract(url=url)
    
    print("Title:", article.title)
    print("Author:", article.authors)
    print("Publish Date:", article.publish_date)
    print("Content:", article.cleaned_text)

# Example usage
parse_news_article("https://example.com/news/article.html")
```

In the above code snippet, we create an instance of the `Goose` class and pass in some optional configuration parameters. We then use the `extract` method to parse the HTML content and extract relevant information from the provided URL.

## Real-Time Aggregation and Display

To make our news aggregation system real-time, we can create a script that periodically fetches the RSS feeds, parses the articles, and displays them on a webpage or in a terminal. We can use a scheduler library like `APScheduler` to schedule the task at regular intervals.

```python
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

def fetch_and_display_news():
    # Fetch RSS feeds
    # Parse and extract news articles
    # Display the articles on a webpage or in a terminal

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
scheduler.add_job(fetch_and_display_news, 'interval', minutes=30)
scheduler.start()
```

In the code snippet above, we define a function `fetch_and_display_news` that performs the necessary tasks. We then use `BackgroundScheduler` from the `APScheduler` library to schedule the function to be executed every 30 minutes.

## Conclusion

Building a real-time news aggregation system using Python and the Goose library allows us to stay updated with the latest news articles from multiple sources without the need to visit each website individually. By leveraging the power of natural language processing and machine learning, we can extract relevant information from the articles and present them in a convenient way.
