In today's digital age, it is becoming increasingly important to verify the credibility and authenticity of news articles. With the rise of fake news and misinformation, building a system that can accurately attribute news articles and verify their credibility is crucial. In this blog post, we will explore how to build such a system using Python and the Goose library.

## What is Goose?
Goose is a Python library that allows you to extract and parse information from web pages. It is particularly well-suited for extracting article content from news websites. With Goose, we can programmatically retrieve news articles and extract important metadata such as the title, text, author, and publication date.

## Steps to Build the System
To build our news attribution and credibility verification system, we can follow these steps:

1. **Installing Goose:** Begin by installing the Goose library. You can use pip to install it by running the following command:
```
pip install goose3
```

2. **Importing Goose:** Next, import the necessary modules from the Goose library in your Python script:
```python
from goose3 import Goose
```

3. **Extracting Article Content:** Use Goose to extract the relevant content from a news article by providing the URL as input:
```python
url = "https://www.example.com/news-article"
g = Goose()
article = g.extract(url=url)
```

4. **Extracting Metadata:** Access the extracted article attributes such as the title, text, author, and publication date:
```python
title = article.title
text = article.cleaned_text
author = article.authors
pub_date = article.publish_date
```

5. **Attribution and Credibility Verification:** Use additional APIs or algorithms to analyze the extracted article information and verify its attribution and credibility. This can be done by checking the author's credibility, cross-referencing with trusted sources, or using natural language processing techniques.

6. **Displaying the Results:** Finally, display the attribution and credibility results to the user or incorporate them into your application as needed.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the Python Goose library, we can build a news attribution and credibility verification system that helps combat the spread of fake news and misinformation. It allows us to programmatically extract article content and metadata, which can be further analyzed to verify the credibility of the news source and author. This system can serve as a valuable tool in ensuring that we consume reliable and trustworthy information in the digital age.
