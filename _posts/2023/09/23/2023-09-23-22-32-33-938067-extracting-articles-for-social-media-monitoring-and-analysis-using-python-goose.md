In the world of social media, monitoring and analyzing articles can provide valuable insights for businesses and individuals alike. One popular tool used for this purpose is Python Goose - a web scraping library specifically designed for extracting article content from web pages.

Python Goose is an open-source library that utilizes machine learning algorithms to extract and parse articles from HTML pages. It takes care of cleaning up the HTML, removing advertisements and other irrelevant content, and returning only the main article content.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Python Goose to extract articles:

```python
import goose3

# Create a Goose instance
g = goose3.Goose()

# Set the URL of the web page containing the article
url = "https://www.example.com/article"

# Extract the article content from the web page
article = g.extract(url=url)

# Print the title and the cleaned text of the article
print(article.title)
print(article.cleaned_text)
```
In the above code, we first import the `goose3` module and then create an instance of the Goose class. We then set the URL of the web page containing the article we want to extract.

Using the `extract()` method, we pass the URL to the goose instance and store the extracted article in the `article` variable. We can then access various properties of the article, such as the title and the cleaned text, by using the appropriate attributes.

Python Goose is a powerful tool that can handle a wide range of web pages and deliver accurate results. It can be used for social media monitoring and analysis by extracting articles from news websites, blogs, or any other sources relevant to your analysis.

By integrating Python Goose into your social media monitoring and analysis workflow, you can gain valuable insights from the articles shared on social media platforms. These insights can help you understand the sentiment, trends, and topics being discussed, thus enabling you to make informed decisions based on the data.
