Collaborative robots, also known as cobots, are designed to work alongside humans in a cooperative manner. These robots are typically lightweight, easy to program, and can be quickly adapted to perform various tasks. Python, being a versatile and popular programming language, provides a convenient way to control collaborative robots and create customized automation solutions. In this blog post, we will explore how to control collaborative robots using Python.

## Why Python?

Python is widely used in the field of robotics due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries. It provides a rich ecosystem of tools and frameworks that can be utilized to communicate with and control collaborative robots. Whether you are using popular cobot brands like Universal Robots, Rethink Robotics, or any other platform, Python can be a great choice for programming and controlling these robots.

## Getting Started

To begin controlling a collaborative robot with Python, you'll need to install the necessary libraries and SDKs specific to your cobot brand. Most cobot manufacturers provide their own Python libraries and software development kits (SDKs) that enable communication and control of the robot.

Once you have installed the required libraries and SDKs, you can start writing Python code to interact with the robot. Let's go through a basic example using the popular Universal Robots UR3 cobot.

## Example: Controlling a Universal Robots UR3

We'll use the Universal Robots URX library, which is a Python library specifically designed for controlling Universal Robots cobots. Here's an example code snippet to get you started:

```python
import urx

# Connect to the robot
robot = urx.Robot("192.168.0.100")

# Move the robot to a desired position
robot.movej((0.0, -1.57, -1.57, -1.57, 1.57, 0.0), vel=0.1, acc=0.1)

# Close the connection
robot.close()
```

In this example, we first import the `urx` library and create an instance of the `Robot` class by providing the IP address of the robot. We then call the `movej` method to move the robot to a specific joint position. Finally, we close the connection to the robot.

This is just a simple example to give you an idea of how to control a collaborative robot using Python. Depending on the specific cobot brand and model you are using, you may have access to a wide range of functionalities such as path planning, gripper control, sensor integration, and more.

## Conclusion

Python provides a powerful and flexible platform for controlling collaborative robots. With the availability of various libraries and SDKs, it is easier than ever to program and control cobots using Python. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced roboticist, Python can be a valuable tool in creating automation solutions with collaborative robots.
