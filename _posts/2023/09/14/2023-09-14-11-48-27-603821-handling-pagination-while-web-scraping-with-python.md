Web scraping is a powerful technique to extract data from websites. However, when dealing with websites that have multiple pages, we need to handle pagination to scrape data from each page.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to handle pagination while web scraping using Python and some popular libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests.

## Understanding Pagination

Pagination is the process of dividing large amounts of data into smaller pages for better readability and performance. Websites often use pagination to display their data in chunks, with each page containing a limited number of records.

To scrape data from paginated websites, we need to go through each page, extract the relevant information, and then proceed to the next page until we have obtained all the desired data.

## Libraries Used

For this tutorial, we will be using the following libraries:

- **Beautiful Soup** (bs4): A Python library for web scraping.
- **Requests** (requests): A Python library for making HTTP requests.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```python
  pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Scraping Paginated Websites

Let's now dive into the code and see how we can scrape data from paginated websites. As an example, we will scrape a hypothetical e-commerce website to extract product information from multiple pages.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Do your scraping logic here
    # Extract required data from the current page
    
    # Check if there is a next page
    next_link = soup.find("a", class_="next")
    if next_link:
        next_page_url = next_link["href"]
        scrape_website(next_page_url) # Recursive call to scrape the next page

# Start scraping from the first page
base_url = "https://example-website.com/products"
scrape_website(base_url)
```

In the above code, we define a function `scrape_website` that takes a URL as an argument. Inside the function, we make an HTTP GET request to the URL and use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content.

Next, we perform our scraping logic to extract the required data from the current page. After that, we use `soup.find()` to find the link for the next page. If a next page link exists, we extract its URL and make a recursive call to `scrape_website` with the next page URL. This process continues until there are no more pages left.

Finally, we start scraping from the first page by calling `scrape_website` with the base URL of the website.

## Conclusion

Handling pagination is an essential part of web scraping when dealing with websites that have multiple pages. By implementing recursion and using libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests, we can easily scrape data across all pages of a paginated website.

Remember to handle any potential errors, implement proper error handling, and follow ethical scraping practices to ensure respectful and lawful use of web scraping techniques.
