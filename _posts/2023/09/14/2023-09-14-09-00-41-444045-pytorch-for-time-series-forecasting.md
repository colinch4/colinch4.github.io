Time series forecasting is a key task in many domains, including finance, weather prediction, and sales forecasting. PyTorch, a popular python library, can be used effectively for building deep learning models that can accurately predict future values in time series data.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use PyTorch to build a time series forecasting model. We will focus on simple feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), both of which are widely used for this task.

## Getting Started

First and foremost, ensure you have PyTorch installed on your machine. You can install it using `pip` with the command:
```bash
pip install torch
```

## Dataset Preparation

Next, we need to prepare our dataset for time series forecasting. Typically, a time series dataset consists of a sequence of observations with associated timestamps. We can load this dataset into PyTorch using its built-in data loading utilities. 

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

# Custom Dataset Class
class TimeSeriesDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Load the data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] # sample data
dataset = TimeSeriesDataset(data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False)
```

## Building the Model

Now that we have our dataset ready, we can proceed to build our forecasting model using PyTorch.

### Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

A basic feedforward neural network can be used for time series forecasting, where the input sequence is fed into the network and the output is the predicted value at the next time step.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class FeedforwardModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(FeedforwardModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = nn.ReLU()(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

RNNs are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks as they can capture the temporal dependencies inherent in the data.

```python
class RNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RNNModel, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        out, _ = self.rnn(x, h0)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out
```

## Training and Evaluation

To train and evaluate our models, we will define a loss function and an optimizer, and then iterate over the dataset to update model parameters.

```python
# Loss function
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for data in dataloader:
        inputs = data[:, :-1]
        targets = data[:, -1]

        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)

        # Compute loss
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)

        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Evaluation
test_input = torch.tensor([11, 12, 13, 14, 15]).unsqueeze(0)
predicted_output = model(test_input)

print("Predicted output:", predicted_output)
```
