Video classification is a challenging task in the field of computer vision. With the advancement of deep learning and frameworks like PyTorch, we can now build powerful models that can automatically classify videos into different categories. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video classification using PyTorch.

## Getting Started

To begin, we need to install the required dependencies. Open a terminal and type the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

This will install PyTorch and torchvision, which provides popular datasets and models for computer vision tasks.

## Dataset Preparation

Next, we need a dataset for training our video classification model. There are many publicly available datasets for this task, such as UCF101 or Kinetics. Let's assume we are using the UCF101 dataset.

First, download the dataset and extract it to a suitable location on your computer. The dataset should have separate folders for each category, with video files inside each folder.

## Preprocessing Videos

Before training our model, we need to preprocess the videos in a format suitable for training. We will convert the videos into a sequence of frames and resize each frame to a fixed size. This can be easily done using OpenCV and NumPy.

Here is an example code snippet to preprocess the videos:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_videos(video_path, output_path, resize_shape):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frame_count = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))
    
    frames = []
    while(cap.isOpened()):
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Resize frame to desired shape
        frame = cv2.resize(frame, resize_shape)
        
        # Convert frame to grayscale
        frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        
        frames.append(frame)
    
    # Convert frames to NumPy array
    frames = np.array(frames)
    
    # Save frames to disk
    np.save(output_path, frames)
    
    cap.release()
```

## Building the Model

Now that we have preprocessed our videos, we can move on to building our video classification model using PyTorch.

We can leverage the power of pre-trained models such as ResNet or DenseNet and fine-tune them on our dataset. PyTorch provides pre-trained models through the `torchvision.models` module.

Here is an example code snippet to build a video classification model using a pre-trained ResNet model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Load pre-trained ResNet model
resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Modify the last fully connected layer to match the number of classes in our dataset
num_classes = 101  # Number of classes in UCF101
resnet.fc = nn.Linear(resnet.fc.in_features, num_classes)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(resnet.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

## Training and Evaluation

After building the model, we can train it using our preprocessed videos. Split the dataset into training and validation sets, and define a data loader to load the videos during training.

Here is an example code snippet to train and evaluate the video classification model:

```python
import torch.utils.data as data

# Define custom dataset class
class VideoDataset(data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, video_paths, targets):
        self.video_paths = video_paths
        self.targets = targets
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.video_paths)
    
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        video_path = self.video_paths[index]
        video = np.load(video_path)
        target = self.targets[index]
        
        return video, target

# Define data loaders for training and validation sets
train_dataset = VideoDataset(train_video_paths, train_targets)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

val_dataset = VideoDataset(val_video_paths, val_targets)
val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in train_loader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = resnet(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    # Evaluate the model on the validation set
    with torch.no_grad():
        total = 0
        correct = 0
        for inputs, targets in val_loader:
            outputs = resnet(inputs)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += targets.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()
        
        accuracy = correct / total
        print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
