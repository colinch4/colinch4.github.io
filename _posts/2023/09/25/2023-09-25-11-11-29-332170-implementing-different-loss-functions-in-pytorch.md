In machine learning, a loss function is used to measure the discrepancy between the predicted output and the actual output. It is an essential component in training a model as it helps in optimizing the model's parameters. PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, provides various loss functions that can be used for different types of tasks.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement different loss functions in PyTorch and when to use them based on the problem at hand.

## 1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE is a commonly used loss function for regression tasks. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The lower the MSE, the better the model is performing.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample predicted and actual outputs
predicted = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.8, 1.2])
actual = torch.tensor([0.4, 0.9, 1.5])

# Compute MSE loss
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
loss = criterion(predicted, actual)
```

## 2. Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)

BCE is used for binary classification problems, where the output is either 0 or 1. It measures the average negative log-likelihood of the predicted probabilities for the true classes.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample predicted probabilities and actual outputs
predicted_probs = torch.tensor([0.3, 0.7, 0.9])
actual = torch.tensor([0, 1, 1])

# Compute BCE loss
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
loss = criterion(predicted_probs, actual.float())
```

## 3. Categorical Cross Entropy (CE)

CE is commonly used for multi-class classification tasks. It measures the average negative log-likelihood of the predicted class probabilities for the true classes.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample predicted class probabilities and actual class indices
predicted_probs = torch.tensor([[0.2, 0.3, 0.5],
                                [0.1, 0.6, 0.3],
                                [0.7, 0.1, 0.2]])
actual_classes = torch.tensor([2, 1, 0])

# Compute CE loss
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = criterion(predicted_probs, actual_classes)
```

## 4. Custom Loss Function

In some cases, you may need to create a custom loss function tailored to your specific problem. To do this, you can define a new class that inherits from the `torch.nn.Module` class and override the `forward()` method.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Custom loss function
class CustomLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, predicted, actual):
        # Custom loss calculation
        loss = torch.mean(torch.abs(predicted - actual))
        return loss

# Usage
predicted = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.8, 1.2])
actual = torch.tensor([0.4, 0.9, 1.5])
criterion = CustomLoss()
loss = criterion(predicted, actual)
```

These are just a few examples of loss functions available in PyTorch. Depending on your specific problem and task, you may need to explore and experiment with different loss functions to achieve optimal results.

Remember to choose the right loss function based on your problem domain, as it can significantly impact the performance of your model.
