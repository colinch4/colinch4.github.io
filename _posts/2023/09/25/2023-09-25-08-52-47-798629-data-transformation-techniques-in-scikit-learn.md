1. Standardization:
Standardization is a widely used technique that helps in scaling numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance. This technique is beneficial when the features have different scales or when we want to compare the importance of features based on their standard deviations. Scikit-learn provides the `StandardScaler` class for standardization.

Here's an example of using `StandardScaler`:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create an instance of the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the scaler to the training data
scaler.fit(X_train)

# Transform the training and test data
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

2. Encoding Categorical Variables:
Machine learning models often require numerical inputs, which makes encoding categorical variables a necessary step. Scikit-learn provides various encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into numerical representations. Two widely used techniques are one-hot encoding and label encoding.

- One-Hot Encoding:
One-hot encoding converts each categorical variable into a binary vector, where each category is represented as a separate binary feature. Scikit-learn offers the `OneHotEncoder` class for one-hot encoding.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Create an instance of the OneHotEncoder
encoder = OneHotEncoder()

# Fit the encoder to the categorical data
encoder.fit(X_train_categorical)

# Transform the training and test data
X_train_encoded = encoder.transform(X_train_categorical)
X_test_encoded = encoder.transform(X_test_categorical)
```

- Label Encoding:
Label encoding assigns a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable. Scikit-learn provides the `LabelEncoder` class for label encoding.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Create an instance of the LabelEncoder
encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Fit the encoder to the categorical data
encoder.fit(y_train)

# Transform the training and test data
y_train_encoded = encoder.transform(y_train)
y_test_encoded = encoder.transform(y_test)
```

These are just two examples of data transformation techniques offered by Scikit-learn. The library provides many more preprocessing tools like scaling, feature extraction, and more. By applying appropriate data transformation techniques, we can improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning models.
