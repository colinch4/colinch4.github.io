Partial dependence plots are a useful tool for understanding the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome in a machine learning model. They allow us to visualize how the predicted outcome changes as we vary a specific feature, while holding all other features constant. In this blog post, we will explore how to create partial dependence plots using Scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning.

## What is a partial dependence plot?

A partial dependence plot shows the relationship between the target variable and one or more feature variables, while keeping all other features constant. It helps in understanding the marginal effect of a feature on the model's predictions. By visualizing the effect of a feature on the predicted outcome, we can gain insights into how the model utilizes that feature and how it contributes to the overall prediction.

## Creating partial dependence plots in Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn provides a simple and efficient way to create partial dependence plots using the `partial_dependence` function. This function calculates the partial dependence values for a given feature or set of features.

To get started, we first need to train a machine learning model. For simplicity, let's use a decision tree classifier from Scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the iris dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a decision tree classifier
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Once we have trained our model, we can create a partial dependence plot for a specific feature using the following code:

```python
from sklearn.inspection import plot_partial_dependence
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a partial dependence plot for feature 2 (petal length)
plot_partial_dependence(model, X_train, features=[2], feature_names=data.feature_names)

plt.show()
```

In the code above, we use the `plot_partial_dependence` function to generate the partial dependence plot for the feature at index 2 (petal length). We pass in the trained model, the training data, and the index of the feature we want to plot. We also provide the `feature_names` argument to label the x-axis of the plot.

## Interpreting partial dependence plots

Once we have generated the partial dependence plot, we can interpret the results. The y-axis represents the predicted outcome, while the x-axis represents the values of the feature we are examining. The line on the plot shows how the predicted outcome changes as we vary the feature.

If the line is flat or close to flat, it indicates that the feature has little or no effect on the predictions. On the other hand, if the line shows a clear upward or downward trend, it suggests a strong relationship between the feature and the outcome. By examining multiple partial dependence plots, we can gain insights into how different features impact the model's predictions.

## Conclusion

Partial dependence plots are a powerful technique for understanding the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome in a machine learning model. By visualizing the effects of individual features on the model's predictions, we can gain valuable insights and improve our understanding of the model's behavior. Using Scikit-learn, we can easily create partial dependence plots and interpret the results. So go ahead and start exploring your models with partial dependence plots to gain a deeper understanding of their predictions.
