## 1. Text Preprocessing

Before we can start building machine learning models on text data, it is crucial to preprocess the text to make it suitable for analysis. Scikit-learn provides several preprocessing techniques:

### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens. Scikit-learn offers the `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` classes for tokenization.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = ['Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.', 'Aenean eu nisl blandit, finibus nisl eget, accumsan nisi.']
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())  # ['accumsan', 'amet', 'aenean', 'blandit', 'dolor', 'eget', 'eu', 'finibus', 'ipsum', 'Lorem', 'nisi', 'nisl', 'sit']
```

### Stopword Removal
Stopwords are common words (e.g., 'the', 'is', 'a') that do not provide much information in text analysis. Scikit-learn provides a built-in list of stopwords that can be used for removal.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = ['Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.', 'Aenean eu nisl blandit, finibus nisl eget, accumsan nisi.']
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())  # ['accumsan', 'amet', 'aenean', 'blandit', 'dolor', 'eget', 'eu', 'finibus', 'ipsum', 'lorem', 'nisi', 'nisl', 'sit']
```

### Text Normalization
Text normalization techniques such as lowercasing, stemming, and lemmatization can also be applied to reduce word variations. Scikit-learn does not provide built-in support for these techniques, but other libraries like NLTK or SpaCy can be used in combination.

## 2. Feature Extraction

Once the text data is preprocessed, we need to convert it into numerical features that can be used in machine learning algorithms. Scikit-learn provides several feature extraction methods:

### Bag-of-Words (BoW)
The bag-of-words model represents text as a sparse matrix where each row corresponds to a document, and each column represents a unique word or token. The cell values indicate the frequency of the word/token in the respective document. The `CountVectorizer` class can be used for BoW feature extraction.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = ['Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.', 'Aenean eu nisl blandit, finibus nisl eget, accumsan nisi.']
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(X.toarray())
# [[0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1]
#  [1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 0]]
```

### TF-IDF Vectorization
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) assigns higher weights to uncommon words in a document compared to widely used ones. The `TfidfVectorizer` class in Scikit-learn can be used to perform TF-IDF vectorization.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

corpus = ['Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.', 'Aenean eu nisl blandit, finibus nisl eget, accumsan nisi.']
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(X.toarray())
# [[0.         0.50461134 0.         0.         0.50461134 0.         0.         0.         0.50461134 0.50461134 0.         0.         0.50461134]
#  [0.38408524 0.         0.38408524 0.38408524 0.         0.38408524 0.38408524 0.38408524 0.         0.         0.38408524 0.76817048 0.38408524]]
```
