Dealing with missing data is a common challenge in data analysis and machine learning. Fortunately, Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, provides useful tools to handle missing data.

## 1. Identifying missing data
Before we can handle missing data, it's important to identify where it exists in our dataset. Scikit-learn provides the `MissingIndicator` class, which can detect missing values in a dataset and create a binary indicator matrix to highlight the locations of missing data.

```python
from sklearn.impute import MissingIndicator

X = [[1, 2], [np.nan, 3], [7, np.nan]]
indicator = MissingIndicator()
indicator.fit_transform(X)

# Output:
# array([[False, False],
#       [ True, False],
#       [False,  True]])
```

## 2. Imputing missing values
Once we've identified the missing data, the next step is to impute or fill in those missing values. Scikit-learn offers several strategies for imputation, such as mean imputation, median imputation, most frequent imputation, and constant imputation.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

X = [[1, 2], [np.nan, 3], [7, np.nan]]
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)

# Output:
# array([[1., 2.],
#        [4., 3.],
#        [7., 2.]])
```

## 3. Handling categorical missing data
In addition to numerical missing data, categorical features can also have missing values. Scikit-learn provides another class called `MissingIndicator` to handle such cases. However, instead of imputing the missing values, we usually encode them separately as a new category.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

X = [['A', 'M'], [np.nan, 'F'], ['B', np.nan]]
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value='N/A')
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)

encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)
X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_imputed)

# Output:
# array([[1., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
#        [0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
#        [0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])
```

## Conclusion
Missing data is a common challenge in data analysis and machine learning. Scikit-learn provides powerful tools to identify and handle missing data. By using the `MissingIndicator` class to detect missing data and the `SimpleImputer` class to impute missing values, we can ensure that our datasets are ready for training machine learning models.
