In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a powerful mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. Python supports both class inheritance and method inheritance, which enables code reuse and promotes a modular design of your code.

## Class Inheritance

Class inheritance, also known as **subclassing**, allows a new class (subclass) to inherit the attributes and behaviors of an existing class (superclass or base class). This means that the subclass can use and override methods and variables defined in the superclass.

To create a subclass, you define it by using the **class** keyword, followed by the subclass name, and inside parentheses, the name of the superclass. Let's say we have a superclass called `Animal` and we want to create a subclass called `Dog`:

```python
class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print("The animal is eating.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")
```

In the example above, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class. This means that the `Dog` class has access to the `eat` method defined in the `Animal` class.

## Method Inheritance

In addition to inheriting class-level attributes and methods, subclasses can also inherit individual methods of the superclass. This is known as **method inheritance**.

To inherit methods from the superclass, the subclass can simply define the same method. By doing this, the subclass can override the behavior of the method or extend it by adding additional functionality. This is known as method overriding and method extension.

```python
class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print("The animal is eating.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def eat(self):
        print("The dog is eating bones.")
```

In the example above, the `Dog` subclass overrides the `eat` method inherited from the `Animal` superclass. Now, when we call the `eat` method on a `Dog` instance, it will display "The dog is eating bones." instead of "The animal is eating."

## Conclusion

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and Python provides robust support for both class inheritance and method inheritance. The ability to reuse code through inheritance promotes code reusability and makes code maintenance easier. By understanding class inheritance and method inheritance, you can create more modular and structured code in Python.
