Websockets are a powerful technology for enabling real-time communication between a client and a server. In Python, there are several packages available for working with websockets. In this blog post, we will explore some of the popular Python packages for packaging websockets and discuss their features and use cases.

## 1. **websocket-client**

[websocket-client](https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/) is a simple, lightweight, and popular Python library for interacting with websockets. It provides a high-level API for sending and receiving data over websockets. 

**Features:**
- It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
- It provides event-driven callbacks for handling incoming messages, connection status changes, and errors.
- Compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.x.

**Use Case:** If you are looking for a straightforward and easy-to-use library for websockets, `websocket-client` is a great choice.

## 2. **websockets**

[websockets](https://pypi.org/project/websockets/) is a powerful, high-performance, and full-featured Python library for building websocket servers and clients. It is built on top of the `asyncio` library, making it well-suited for asynchronous applications.

**Features:**
- It supports both server-side and client-side websocket implementations.
- Provides comprehensive functionality for handling connections, sending and receiving messages, and managing protocols.
- Supports SSL/TLS encryption and WebSocket Extension draft specifications.
- Compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

**Use Case:** If you need an advanced and feature-rich library for building websocket-based applications, `websockets` is an excellent choice.

## Conclusion

Python offers several packaging options for working with websockets, each with its own set of features and use cases. Whether you need a lightweight and simple library like `websocket-client` or a full-featured library like `websockets`, Python has got you covered. Choose the library that best fits your project requirements and start building real-time applications with websockets in Python.
