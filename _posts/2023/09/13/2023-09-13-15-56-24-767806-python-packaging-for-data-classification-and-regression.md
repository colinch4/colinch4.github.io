Data classification and regression are essential tasks in machine learning and data analysis. Python provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged for building models and performing these tasks efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore the different packaging options available in Python for data classification and regression.

## 1. Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides a comprehensive set of tools for data analysis, including data classification and regression algorithms. It supports various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more. Here's an example of using the logistic regression algorithm from sklearn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the dataset
X = [[2, 1], [3, 4], [1, 6], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4, 4]]
y = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

# Create an instance of the logistic regression classifier
clf = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
clf.fit(X, y)

# Predict the class for new data
new_data = [[2, 3], [1, 5]]
predicted_classes = clf.predict(new_data)

print(predicted_classes)
```

## 2. TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning developed by Google. It provides a flexible and scalable ecosystem to build and deploy machine learning models, including data classification and regression. TensorFlow allows you to define and train neural networks using its high-level API, Keras. Here's an example of using TensorFlow for data classification:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load the dataset
X = [[2, 1], [3, 4], [1, 6], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4, 4]]
y = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

# Predict the class for new data
new_data = [[2, 3], [1, 5]]
predicted_classes = model.predict_classes(new_data)

print(predicted_classes)
```
