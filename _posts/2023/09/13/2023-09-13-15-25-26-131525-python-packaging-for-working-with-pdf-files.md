PDF files are a popular and widely-used format for document exchange and storage. Many Python libraries and tools are available for working with PDF files, making it easier to manipulate, extract information from, and generate PDF documents programmatically.

In this blog post, we will explore some of the popular Python libraries and tools for working with PDF files and discuss how to package and distribute Python applications related to PDF manipulation.

## 1. PyPDF2

[PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) is a pure Python library that allows you to work with PDF files. It provides functionality to extract text, merge multiple PDFs, and manipulate individual pages. PyPDF2 is widely used and has a simple and intuitive API, making it a good choice for basic PDF processing tasks.

To install PyPDF2, you can use the following command:

```shell
pip install PyPDF2
```

## 2. pdfrw

[pdfrw](https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw) is another Python library for reading and writing PDF files. It offers a low-level API for handling PDFs, allowing you to access and modify PDF objects directly. pdfrw provides functionality to parse PDF files, extract text and images, and perform low-level PDF manipulation tasks.

To install pdfrw, you can use the following command:

```shell
pip install pdfrw
```

## 3. ReportLab

[ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/) is a powerful Python library for generating PDF documents. It allows you to create complex layouts, add images, charts, and tables, and customize the appearance of PDFs. ReportLab provides both high-level APIs for simple PDF generation tasks and low-level APIs for advanced customization.

To install ReportLab, you can use the following command:

```shell
pip install reportlab
```

## 4. PyMuPDF

[PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) is a Python binding for the MuPDF library, which is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer. PyMuPDF provides functionality to read and extract information from PDF files, as well as render PDF pages as images. It offers a high level of performance and memory efficiency.

To install PyMuPDF, you can use the following command:

```shell
pip install PyMuPDF
```

## Packaging and Distribution

When packaging a Python application that uses PDF manipulation libraries, it is essential to include the required libraries as dependencies. You can specify these dependencies in the `setup.py` file or using a `requirements.txt` file.

For example, if your application uses PyPDF2 and ReportLab, you can include the following lines in your `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
PyPDF2==1.26.0
reportlab==3.5.68
```

When distributing your Python application, you can use tools like [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) or [PyOxidizer](https://www.pyoxidizer.org/) to package it as a standalone executable, including the required PDF manipulation libraries.

## Conclusion

Python provides a variety of libraries and tools for working with PDF files, allowing you to manipulate, extract information from, and generate PDF documents programmatically. Libraries like PyPDF2, pdfrw, ReportLab, and PyMuPDF offer different levels of functionality and flexibility for various PDF-related tasks.

When packaging and distributing Python applications related to PDF manipulation, ensure to include the necessary library dependencies and use tools like PyInstaller or PyOxidizer for packaging as standalone executables.
