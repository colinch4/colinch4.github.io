To define the `__init__` method in a class, you need to include it as a method inside the class definition. The method is always named `__init__`, with two underscores on each side.

Here is an example of how the `__init__` method is defined and used in a Python class:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def print_details(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}")
        print(f"Age: {self.age}")

# Creating an object from the Person class
person1 = Person("John Doe", 25)

# Calling the print_details method of the object
person1.print_details()
```

In this example, the `__init__` method takes two parameters: `name` and `age`. These parameters are used to initialize two attributes of the `Person` object: `name` and `age`.

When we create an object `person1` from the `Person` class, the `__init__` method is automatically called. The values passed to the `__init__` method are assigned to the `name` and `age` attributes of the object.

After creating the object `person1`, we can call the `print_details` method to print the details of the person.

Using the `__init__` method allows us to set the initial state of an object when it is created, making it easier to manage and manipulate objects in our Python programs.
