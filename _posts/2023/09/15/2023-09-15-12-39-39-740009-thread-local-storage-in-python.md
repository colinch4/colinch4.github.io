In multi-threaded programming, it is often necessary to have variables that are local to each thread. These variables are typically referred to as thread-local storage (TLS). Python provides a built-in module called `threading` which allows us to implement thread-local storage easily.

To use thread-local storage in Python, we can make use of the `local` class from the `threading` module. This class allows us to create an object that is unique to each thread.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of thread-local storage in Python:

```python
import threading

# create thread-local storage
tls = threading.local()

def set_value(value):
    # set the thread-specific value
    tls.value = value

def get_value():
    # retrieve the thread-specific value
    return getattr(tls, 'value', None)

def worker():
    # set the thread-specific value for each thread
    set_value(threading.current_thread().name)
     
    # retrieve and print the thread-specific value
    print(f"Thread name: {threading.current_thread().name}, Value: {get_value()}")

# create multiple threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=worker)

# start the threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# wait for the threads to finish
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```

In the code above, we define the `tls` object as a thread-local storage using the `local()` function from the `threading` module. We then define two functions: `set_value()` to set the thread-specific value, and `get_value()` to retrieve the thread-specific value.

In the `worker()` function, we set the thread-specific value to the name of the current thread using `set_value()` and retrieve it using `get_value()`. Finally, we create two threads and start them using the `start()` method. The `join()` method is used to wait for the threads to complete.

When you run the code, you will see that each thread has its own thread-specific value associated with it. This demonstrates the implementation of thread-local storage in Python using the `threading` module.

Using thread-local storage can be beneficial when working with multi-threaded applications that require thread-specific data. It ensures that each thread has its own private space to store and retrieve values, without interfering with other threads.
