PyCharm is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for Python, offering numerous features to make coding and debugging easier. One of the fundamental tasks in PyCharm is running Python scripts. In this blog post, we will explore the different ways to run Python scripts in PyCharm.

## Method 1: Running Python Scripts from the Editor

The most straightforward way to run a Python script in PyCharm is to execute it directly from the editor. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Python script in the PyCharm editor.
2. Make sure the script you want to run is the active tab in the editor.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+F10` on macOS. Alternatively, you can right-click anywhere in the editor and choose "Run <script_name>.py" from the context menu.

PyCharm will execute the script and display the output in the Run tool window.

## Method 2: Running Python Scripts as Configurations

PyCharm allows you to create and save configurations to run your Python scripts. This method is useful when you want to specify various options, such as command-line arguments, environment variables, or interpreter settings. Here's how you can run a Python script as a configuration:

1. Open the Python script in the PyCharm editor.
2. Go to the toolbar and click on the **Edit Configurations** button (or `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...` from the menu).
3. In the Configurations dialog, click on the `+` button and select "Python" from the drop-down menu.
4. Configure the necessary options, such as script path, interpreter, and command-line arguments.
5. Click on the "Apply" button and then "OK" to save the configuration.

To run the script using the configuration, follow these steps:

1. Open the Run/Debug Configurations dropdown in the toolbar.
2. Select the configuration you want to run.
3. Click on the green "Run" button or press `Shift+F10` to execute the script.

## Conclusion

Running Python scripts in PyCharm is straightforward, either through the editor or by creating and using configurations. By utilizing PyCharm's powerful features, you can streamline your Python development process and enhance your productivity.
