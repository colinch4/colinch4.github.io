Python provides several built-in functions for performing file input/output (I/O) operations. These functions allow you to read from or write to files, manipulate file pointers, and handle exceptions that may occur during file operations.

In this article, we will explore some commonly used file I/O functions in Python and how to use them effectively with functions.

## Open a File

To open a file in Python, we use the `open()` function. It takes two parameters - the filename (including the path, if it's in a different directory) and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'a' for appending. For example:

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
```

## Reading from a File

Once a file is opened in reading mode, we can use the `read()` or `readlines()` function to read the contents of the file. The `read()` function reads the entire file as a single string, while the `readlines()` function reads the file line by line and returns a list of strings.

Here's an example of how to read from a file using a function:

```python
def read_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        return content

file_content = read_file('example.txt')
print(file_content)
```

## Writing to a File

To write to a file, we need to open it in 'w' mode. We can then use the `write()` function to write the content to the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it already exists, the existing content will be overwritten.

Here's an example of a function that writes content to a file:

```python
def write_to_file(file_name, content):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

write_to_file('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')
```

## Appending to a File

To append content to an existing file, we need to open it in 'a' mode. We can then use the `write()` function to append the content to the file.

Here's an example of a function that appends content to a file:

```python
def append_to_file(file_name, content):
    with open(file_name, 'a') as file:
        file.write(content)

append_to_file('example.txt', '\nThis is an appended line.')
```

## Closing a File

It is important to close the file when we are done with it. We can either use the `close()` function or use the file in a `with` statement, which automatically closes the file once the block of code is executed.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
# do something with the file
file.close()
```

## Conclusion

Python provides powerful file I/O functions that allow us to read from and write to files easily. By using functions, we can encapsulate file I/O operations and make our code more modular and reusable. Remember to always close the file after you're done with it to free up system resources.
