Flask is a popular Python web framework that allows developers to quickly build web applications. While Flask provides built-in templates for rendering HTML, you may want to customize the appearance of your Flask application by adding CSS styles.

## Adding CSS to Flask Templates

To add CSS styles to your Flask application, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new CSS file: Create a new file in your Flask application's static folder and name it `styles.css`. The static folder is where you store static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

2. Link the CSS file in your HTML templates: In the `<head>` section of your HTML template(s), add the following line of code to link the CSS file:

   ```html
   {% raw %}
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">
   {% endraw %}
   ```

   This line tells Flask to serve the CSS file located in the `static` folder.

3. Write your CSS styles: Open the `styles.css` file and start writing your CSS code. You can target the HTML elements in your Flask templates by using CSS selectors.

   For example, if you want to change the color of all `<h1>` headings in your application to blue, you can add the following CSS code to `styles.css`:

   ```css
   h1 {
     color: blue;
   }
   ```

   Feel free to add your own custom CSS styles to modify the appearance of your Flask application.

## Updating Flask Templates with CSS Classes

Another way to customize the appearance of your Flask application is by adding CSS classes to specific HTML elements.

1. Add CSS classes in your HTML templates: In your HTML templates, add the `class` attribute to the HTML elements you want to customize. For example, if you have a `<div>` element that you want to style differently, you can add a class to it like this:

   ```html
   <div class="custom-div">
     ...
   </div>
   ```

2. Define CSS styles for the classes: In your `styles.css` file, define the CSS styles for the classes you added. For example, to change the background color of the `custom-div` class, you can add the following CSS code:

   ```css
   .custom-div {
     background-color: #f1f1f1;
   }
   ```

   Now, any `<div>` elements with the `custom-div` class will have a light gray background.

## Conclusion

Customizing the appearance of your Flask application with CSS allows you to create visually appealing and unique web experiences. By adding CSS styles to your Flask templates, you can modify the look and feel of your application. Additionally, using CSS classes allows for more granular customization of specific elements. Experiment with different styles and watch your Flask application come to life!
