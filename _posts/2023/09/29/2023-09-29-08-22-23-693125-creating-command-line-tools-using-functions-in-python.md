In this digital era, command-line tools have become an essential part of software development and automation. Command-line tools provide a way for users to interact with software through a text-based interface, allowing for greater flexibility and control. Python, being a versatile language, offers several ways to create command-line tools. One approach is to use functions, making the development process more modular and easier to maintain.

## Writing a Simple Command-Line Tool

Let's start by writing a simple command-line tool that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a Python function. 

```python
```python
import sys

def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit."""
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit

def main():
    """Main entry point of the command-line tool."""
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python temperature_converter.py <celsius>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    celsius = float(sys.argv[1])
    fahrenheit = celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)
    print(f"{celsius}째C is equivalent to {fahrenheit}째F.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the above code, we define a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that takes the temperature in Celsius as a parameter and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. The `main` function is the entry point of our command-line tool. It checks if the user provided a valid input, extracts the Celsius value from the command-line arguments, calls the `celsius_to_fahrenheit` function, and displays the result.

## Running the Command-Line Tool

To run the command-line tool, save the code to a file (e.g., `temperature_converter.py`) and execute it from the command line:

```bash
$ python temperature_converter.py 25
25째C is equivalent to 77.0째F.
```

Here, we pass `25` as the input temperature in Celsius. The tool then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result on the command line.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of functions, we can create efficient and reusable command-line tools in Python. Functions allow us to modularize our code and make it more maintainable. This approach enables us to extend the functionality of the tool easily by adding new functions or modifying existing ones. Armed with this knowledge, you can now start building your own command-line tools using functions in Python.
