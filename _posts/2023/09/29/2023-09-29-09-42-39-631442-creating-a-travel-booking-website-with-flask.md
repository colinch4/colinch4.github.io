## Introduction

In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of creating a travel booking website using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. Flask offers simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for developing web applications. By following the steps outlined below, you will be able to build your own travel booking website in no time.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your computer. If you don't have Flask installed, you can install it using pip with the following command:

```
pip install flask
```

Once Flask is installed, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line. Inside the project directory, create a new Python file called `app.py` which will serve as the main entry point for your Flask application.

## Creating Routes and Views

In Flask, routes define the URLs that users can visit in your application. Let's create some basic routes for our travel booking website:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to our travel booking website.'

@app.route('/destinations')
def destinations():
    return 'Browse our available destinations.'

@app.route('/booking/<int:booking_id>')
def booking(booking_id):
    return f'Viewing booking with ID: {booking_id}'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In the above code, we import the `Flask` class and create a new instance of it called `app`. We then define three routes: the home route at `'/'`, the destinations route at `'/destinations'`, and the booking route at `'/booking/<int:booking_id>'`. Each route is associated with a view function that returns a simple string.

## Adding Templates and Styling

To enhance the appearance of our travel booking website, we can use templates and stylesheets. Flask allows us to render HTML templates using the Jinja2 templating engine. Create a directory called `templates` inside your project directory and place an HTML file called `home.html` inside it. Here's an example of what the template could look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Travel Booking Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to our travel booking website</h1>
    <p>Choose your destination and book your dream vacation.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above code, we import the CSS file `style.css` located in the `static` directory. Speaking of which, create another directory called `static` inside your project directory and place a CSS file called `style.css` inside it. Add your desired styles to this file to customize the look and feel of your website.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have learned how to create a basic travel booking website using Flask. This is just the beginning, and you can further expand and enhance your website by adding additional features such as user authentication, payment integration, and interactive forms. Flask provides you with the foundation to build sophisticated web applications while keeping the development process simple and enjoyable.
