To define a variable-length argument in a Python function, you can use the asterisk (*) symbol before the parameter name. This is known as the "splat" operator. Let's take a look at an example to better understand how it works:

```python
def calculate_sum(*numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total
```

In the above code, the `calculate_sum` function takes multiple arguments, denoted by the `*numbers`. These arguments are treated as a tuple within the function, allowing you to loop through them and perform the desired operation. In this case, we are calculating the sum of all the numbers passed to the function.

Here's how you can use the `calculate_sum` function:

```python
result = calculate_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 15

result = calculate_sum(10, 20, 30)
print(result)  # Output: 60
```

As you can see, you can pass any number of arguments to the `calculate_sum` function, and it will compute the sum correctly.

You can also combine variable-length arguments with regular arguments. In such cases, the regular arguments must be specified before the variable-length argument. Here's an example that demonstrates this:

```python
def calculate_product(factor, *numbers):
    product = factor
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product
```

In this code snippet, the `calculate_product` function takes a `factor` argument followed by a variable number of `numbers`. The `factor` argument is a regular argument, whereas the `*numbers` collects any additional arguments as a tuple.

Here's how you can use the `calculate_product` function:

```python
result = calculate_product(2, 3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 24

result = calculate_product(5, 2, 4, 6)
print(result)  # Output: 240
```

Variable-length arguments provide flexibility and can enhance the usability of your Python functions. They allow you to handle cases where the number of inputs may vary, making your code more versatile and adaptable to different scenarios.
