Python comes with a wide range of built-in functions that provide essential functionality for performing common tasks. These functions are readily available and can be used directly without the need for additional libraries or modules. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most commonly used built-in functions in Python.

## 1. print()

The `print()` function is used to display output to the console. It takes one or more arguments and displays them on the screen. Here's an example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## 2. len()

The `len()` function returns the length of an object. It can be used to determine the number of elements in a sequence like a string, list, or tuple. Here's an example:

```python
name = "John Doe"
print(len(name))
```

## 3. range()

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. It can be used to iterate over a sequence of numbers using loops. Here's an example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## 4. type()

The `type()` function returns the type of an object. It can be used to determine the type of data stored in a variable. Here's an example:

```python
age = 25
print(type(age))
```

## 5. input()

The `input()` function allows you to accept user input from the console. It prompts the user for input and returns a string. Here's an example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

These are just a few examples of the many built-in functions available in Python. By understanding and utilizing these functions effectively, you can write more efficient and concise code. Remember to refer to the Python documentation for a comprehensive list of built-in functions and their usage.
