The general syntax of a return statement in Python is as follows:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Code block
    return expression
```

The `expression` can be a variable, a calculation, or any valid Python expression that represents the result you want to return.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of return statement in a Python function:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)
```

In this example, the function `add_numbers` takes two parameters `num1` and `num2` and calculates their sum. The `return sum` statement sends the result back to the caller.

Upon executing `result = add_numbers(5, 3)`, the function is called with the arguments 5 and 3. The returned value, which is the sum of the numbers, is assigned to the variable `result`. Finally, the `print` statement displays the result as "The sum is: 8".

The return statement is not mandatory in a function. If a function doesn't have a return statement, it implicitly returns `None`. However, in most cases, you'll use the return statement to provide a meaningful result.

Using the return statement effectively will make your Python functions more versatile and allow you to pass valuable information back to the caller.
