Debugging is an essential part of the software development process. It helps identify and fix issues in your code, ensuring that it runs smoothly and produces the desired output. In this blog post, we'll explore some effective techniques for debugging functions in Python.

### 1. Print statements

One of the simplest and most commonly used debugging techniques is adding print statements to your code. By strategically placing print statements at different points in your function, you can see the values of variables and track the execution flow.

```python
def my_function(x, y):
    print("Starting my_function")
    print("x =", x)
    print("y =", y)
    
    result = x + y
    
    print("Result =", result)
    print("Ending my_function")
    return result
```

### 2. Using a debugger

Python provides a built-in debugger called `pdb` that allows you to step through your code and inspect variables in real-time. By setting breakpoints at specific lines, you can pause the execution of your function and examine the state of your program.

```python
import pdb

def my_function(x, y):
    pdb.set_trace()
    
    result = x + y
    
    return result
```

When you run your code with the `pdb` module, it will stop at the line where you placed the `set_trace()` function and open a command-line interface for debugging. You can then inspect variables, execute code line by line, and navigate through the execution flow.

### 3. Assertions

Assertions are statements used to validate the correctness of assumptions in your code. They help detect errors early on by checking if a given condition is `True` or `False`. If the condition is `False`, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

```python
def my_function(x, y):
    assert isinstance(x, int), "x must be an integer"
    assert isinstance(y, int), "y must be an integer"
    
    result = x + y
    
    return result
```

By using assertions, you can verify that the inputs to your function are of the correct type or meet certain criteria. If any of the assertions fail, you'll get an informative error message indicating what went wrong.
