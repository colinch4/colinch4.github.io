Flask is a popular micro web framework written in Python. It is commonly used for developing web applications and APIs. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a recipe sharing platform using Flask.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check the Python version by running `python --version` in your terminal.

Next, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal. Run the following commands to create a virtual environment and activate it:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now we can install Flask:

```shell
pip install flask
```

## Creating the Flask Application

Create a new file called `app.py` and open it in your preferred code or text editor. Import the necessary modules and initialize a Flask app:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

## Defining Routes

In Flask, routes are used to handle different URLs or endpoints. Let's define a couple of routes for our recipe sharing platform.

```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to Recipe Sharing Platform!"

@app.route('/recipes')
def get_recipes():
    return "List of recipes"

@app.route('/recipes/<int:recipe_id>')
def get_recipe(recipe_id):
    return f"Recipe {recipe_id}"

@app.route('/recipes', methods=['POST'])
def create_recipe():
    return "Recipe created!"

@app.route('/recipes/<int:recipe_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_recipe(recipe_id):
    return f"Recipe {recipe_id} updated!"

@app.route('/recipes/<int:recipe_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_recipe(recipe_id):
    return f"Recipe {recipe_id} deleted!"
```

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python app.py
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```shell
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the home page of your recipe sharing platform.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored the process of creating a recipe sharing platform using Flask. We learned how to set up a Flask project, define routes, and run the application. You can build upon this foundation and add more features to create a fully functional recipe sharing platform. Enjoy coding!
