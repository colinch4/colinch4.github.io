In the world of programming, the concept of function purity is an important principle to understand. It refers to functions that, given the same input, always produce the same output and have no side effects. This concept is particularly prevalent in functional programming languages like Haskell, but it can also be applied to Python.

## Understanding Pure Functions

A pure function is a function that has the following characteristics:

1. **Deterministic**: The function will always return the same output for the same input. It does not depend on any external state that can be changed during program execution.

2. **No Side Effects**: The function does not modify any data outside of its own scope. It does not change any global variables or modify input parameters.

## Benefits of Using Pure Functions

Using pure functions in your code has several advantages:

1. **Readability**: Since pure functions do not have any side effects, they are easier to reason about and understand. You can simply look at the function signature and know what it does without worrying about any hidden modifications.

2. **Testability**: Pure functions are easy to test because they produce predictable results. Given the same input, you can expect the same output every time, making it easier to write unit tests for your code.

3. **Reusability**: Pure functions can be reused in different parts of your program without any concerns. They are self-contained and isolated from the rest of the codebase, making them easier to refactor and maintain.

## Examples of Pure and Impure Functions in Python

Let's take a look at some examples to illustrate the difference between pure and impure functions in Python:

### Pure Function Example

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

The `add` function above is a pure function. Given the same input parameters `a` and `b`, it will always return the same result. There are no side effects, and it does not modify any data outside of its own scope.

### Impure Function Example

```python
total = 0

def increment_counter():
    global total
    total += 1
```

The `increment_counter` function above is an impure function. It modifies the global variable `total` each time it is called, leading to a change in the program state. Therefore, it is not deterministic and has side effects.

## Conclusion

Understanding the concept of function purity is important for writing clean, maintainable, and predictable code. By utilizing pure functions, you can enhance the readability, testability, and reusability of your Python programs. So, embrace the concept of function purity and strive to write pure functions whenever possible.
