To declare a global variable inside a function, you need to use the `global` keyword followed by the variable name. For example:

```python
def my_function():
    global counter
    counter = 0
    print("Counter inside the function:", counter)
    
my_function()
print("Counter outside the function:", counter)
```

In this example, we declare a global variable `counter` inside the `my_function` function. We then assign a value of 0 to it and print its value inside the function. After calling the function, we print the value of `counter` again outside the function. Both print statements will output the value of `counter` as 0.

It's important to note that while you can modify global variables inside a function, you can't reassign a new value to them without using the `global` keyword. For example:

```python
def update_counter():
    global counter
    counter += 1

update_counter()
print("Updated counter:", counter)
```

In this case, we define a function `update_counter` which increments the global `counter` variable by 1. Without using the `global` keyword, Python would create a local variable `counter` inside the function instead of updating the global variable. The final print statement will display the updated value of `counter`.

Using global variables in functions can be useful, but it's important to consider potential issues. They can lead to code that is harder to understand, maintain, and debug. It is generally advisable to use function arguments and return values to pass data between functions, which can result in more modular and reusable code.
