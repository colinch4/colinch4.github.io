## What is a regular expression?

A regular expression, often abbreviated as regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It consists of normal characters and special characters, known as metacharacters, which represent patterns or sets of characters.

## How to use regular expressions for pattern transformation

### Pattern matching

Using regular expressions, you can match specific patterns in a given text. For example, if you want to find all email addresses in a string, you can use the following regular expression in Python:

```python
import re

text = "Email me at john@example.com or jane@example.com"
pattern = r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)
```

The pattern `r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"` matches the standard format of an email address. The `re.findall()` function returns a list of all matches found in the text.

### Pattern transformation

Regular expressions also allow you to transform text based on specific patterns. For example, if you want to remove all digits from a string, you can use the `re.sub()` function in Python:

```python
import re

text = "Hello123 World456"
pattern = r"\d"

transformed_text = re.sub(pattern, "", text)
print(transformed_text)
```

The pattern `r"\d"` matches any digit in the text. The `re.sub()` function replaces all matches with an empty string, effectively removing the digits from the text.

### Capturing groups

Regular expressions also support capturing groups, which allow you to extract specific parts of a text. For example, if you want to extract the username and domain from an email address, you can use the following regular expression in JavaScript:

```javascript
const text = "Email me at john@example.com";
const pattern = /\b([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+)@([A-Za-z0-9.-]+)\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b/;

const matches = text.match(pattern);
const username = matches[1];
const domain = matches[2];

console.log(username);
console.log(domain);
```

The pattern `/\b([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+)@([A-Za-z0-9.-]+)\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b/` uses capturing groups `( )` to extract the username and domain separately. The `text.match()` function returns an array containing the whole match and the captured groups.

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern transformation in programming. They allow you to perform pattern matching, transformation, and extraction in a concise and efficient manner. Understanding regular expressions and their usage can greatly enhance your text processing capabilities in various programming languages.
