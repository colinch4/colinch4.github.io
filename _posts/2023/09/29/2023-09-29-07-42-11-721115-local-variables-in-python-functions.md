To define a local variable in a Python function, you simply assign a value to it within the function body. Here's an example:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    # defining local variable
    local_sum = a + b
    return local_sum

result = calculate_sum(5, 10)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

In the above code, `local_sum` is a local variable within the `calculate_sum()` function. It is assigned the value of the sum of `a` and `b`. The function returns `local_sum`, and it is then assigned to the variable `result` outside the function. Finally, `15` is printed as the sum of `5` and `10`.

One important thing to note is that local variables have a scope limited to the function in which they are declared. They cannot be accessed outside their function. For example, if you try to access `local_sum` outside the `calculate_sum()` function, you'll get a `NameError`.

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    local_sum = a + b
    return local_sum

print(local_sum)  # Output: NameError: name 'local_sum' is not defined
```

This error occurs because `local_sum` is not defined in the global scope.

Local variables in Python functions are essential for encapsulation and maintaining the integrity of data within a function. They allow functions to hold temporary data without interfering with other parts of the code. It is good practice to use local variables whenever you need to store and manipulate data within a specific function scope.
