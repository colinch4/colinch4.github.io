Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform NLP tasks using functions in Python.

## Tokenization
One of the first steps in NLP is tokenization, which involves breaking a text into individual words or tokens. This can be useful for tasks such as frequency analysis and text generation. Let's write a function in Python to tokenize a given text:

```python
def tokenize(text):
    tokens = text.split()
    return tokens
```

To use this function, we can pass a text string as an argument and it will return a list of tokens.

## Removing Stop Words
Stop words are commonly occurring words in a language, such as "and", "the", and "is", which do not carry much meaning in a text. Removing stop words can help to reduce noise and improve the performance of NLP models. Here's a function to remove stop words from a list of tokens using the NLTK library:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

def remove_stopwords(tokens):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
    return filtered_tokens
```

After tokenizing the text, we can pass the list of tokens to the `remove_stopwords` function. It will return a filtered list of tokens without the stop words.

## Text Lemmatization
Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. This can be helpful in tasks such as text analysis, where we want to consider different inflectional forms of a word as the same. Let's write a function to lemmatize a list of tokens using the `nltk` library's WordNet lemmatizer:

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

def lemmatize(tokens):
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    lemmatized_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]
    return lemmatized_tokens
```

By passing the list of tokens to the `lemmatize` function, we can obtain a list of lemmatized tokens.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to perform basic NLP tasks using functions in Python. We learned about tokenization, stop word removal, and text lemmatization. These functions can be useful in various NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and information retrieval. By leveraging these techniques, we can extract valuable insights from textual data and build more intelligent language models.
