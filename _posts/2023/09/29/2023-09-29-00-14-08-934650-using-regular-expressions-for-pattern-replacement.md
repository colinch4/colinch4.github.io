In most programming languages, regular expressions are supported through built-in functions or libraries. Let's take a look at an example in Python using the `re` module:

```python
import re

# Example string with a pattern to be replaced
string = "I have 10 apples and 5 oranges."

# Define the pattern to be replaced
pattern = r"\d+"

# Define the new value
new_value = "20"

# Perform the replacement using regex
new_string = re.sub(pattern, new_value, string)

print(new_string)
```

In this example, we have a string that contains numbers. We want to replace all the numbers with the value "20". 

The `re.sub()` function is used to perform the replacement. It takes three arguments: the pattern to search for, the new value to replace the pattern with, and the input string.

The pattern `r"\d+"` is a regular expression pattern that matches one or more digits. It uses the `\d` special character to match any digit and the `+` quantifier to specify one or more occurrences.

The resulting `new_string` will be "I have 20 apples and 20 oranges." because all the numbers in the original string have been replaced with "20".

Regular expressions offer a lot of flexibility when it comes to pattern matching and replacement. You can use different regular expression patterns to match specific patterns and apply custom replacements based on your requirements.

**Using regular expressions for pattern replacement can be extremely useful in data processing, text parsing, and string manipulation tasks.** They allow you to find and replace specific patterns within strings efficiently. Understanding and applying regular expressions can greatly simplify your programming tasks and make your code more robust and flexible.
