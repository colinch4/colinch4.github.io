Recursion is a powerful programming concept in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. It can be a useful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

Here's an example of a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

In this example, the `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as an input and returns its factorial. 

The base case of the recursion occurs when `n` equals 0, in which case the function returns 1. The recursive case occurs when `n` is greater than 0. In the recursive case, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. 

Let's see how the `factorial` function works for a given input:

```python
print(factorial(5))
```
Output: 120

Here's a breakdown of how the `factorial` function works for `factorial(5)`:

- `factorial(5)` calls `factorial(4)`
- `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)`
- `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)`
- `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)`
- `factorial(1)` calls `factorial(0)`
- `factorial(0)` returns 1
- `factorial(1)` multiplies the result of `factorial(0)` (which is 1) by 1 and returns 1
- `factorial(2)` multiplies the result of `factorial(1)` (which is 1) by 2 and returns 2
- `factorial(3)` multiplies the result of `factorial(2)` (which is 2) by 3 and returns 6
- `factorial(4)` multiplies the result of `factorial(3)` (which is 6) by 4 and returns 24
- `factorial(5)` multiplies the result of `factorial(4)` (which is 24) by 5 and returns 120

Recursion can be an elegant solution to certain problems, but it should be used with caution. Recursive functions can consume a significant amount of memory and lead to stack overflow errors if not implemented properly. It's important to ensure that the base case is defined correctly and that the function converges towards the base case with each recursive call.
