Flask is a powerful micro web framework for building web applications using Python. Once you have developed your Flask application, the next step is to deploy it on a web server so that it can be accessed by users over the internet. In this blog post, we will explore the process of deploying a Flask application on a web server.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A Flask application ready for deployment.
2. A web server with SSH access.

## Step 1: Prepare the Web Server

First, connect to your web server using SSH. Then, ensure that the server has the necessary software installed, including Python, pip, and any required dependencies for your Flask application.

```bash
$ ssh user@web_server_ip_address
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev nginx
```

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate your Flask application's dependencies. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

```bash
$ mkdir flask_project
$ cd flask_project
```

Next, create a virtual environment and activate it.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Now that your virtual environment is active, you can install the necessary Python packages for your Flask application.

```bash
$ pip install flask gunicorn
```

Make sure to include any other dependencies your application requires by installing them using pip.

## Step 4: Configure Nginx

Nginx will act as a reverse proxy server that passes requests from clients to your Flask application. First, create a new Nginx server block configuration file.

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp
```

Add the following configuration to the file, replacing `your_domain` and `your_flask_app_name` with appropriate values:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Next, enable the server block by creating a symbolic link and restarting Nginx.

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 5: Run the Application

Now it's time to run your Flask application using Gunicorn, a WSGI HTTP server.

```bash
$ gunicorn your_flask_app_name:app
```

This command starts Gunicorn and runs your Flask application on the default port 8000. You can customize the command according to your application's configuration.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily deploy your Flask application on a web server using Nginx and Gunicorn. Make sure to properly configure your server settings and keep security best practices in mind.
