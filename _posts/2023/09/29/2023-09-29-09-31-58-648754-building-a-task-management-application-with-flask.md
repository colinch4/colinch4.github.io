In this blog post, we will walk through the process of building a task management application using Flask, a popular web framework in Python. Flask provides a robust and flexible environment for building web applications, making it an ideal choice for this project.

## Requirements

Before we begin, let's define the requirements for our task management application:

1. Users should be able to create, update, and delete tasks.
2. Tasks should have a title, description, and due date.
3. Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.
4. Tasks should be displayed in a list, sorted by due date.

## Setting up the Flask Environment

To start, we need to set up a Flask environment. Here are the steps to follow:

### Step 1: Install Flask

First, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org) if you haven't already. Once Python is installed, open a terminal and run the following command to install Flask:

```python
pip install flask
```

### Step 2: Create a Flask App

Next, create a new directory for your Flask app and navigate to it in the terminal. In this directory, create a new file called `app.py` and open it in your preferred text editor. In `app.py`, import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

### Step 3: Define Routes

Now that we have our Flask app set up, we can define the routes for our task management application. Add the following code to `app.py`:

```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Task Management App!"

@app.route('/tasks')
def tasks():
    return "List of tasks will be displayed here."

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>')
def task_detail(task_id):
    return f"Details for task {task_id} will be displayed here."
```

### Step 4: Run the App

To run the Flask app and see the output of our routes, add the following lines to the bottom of `app.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Save the file and go back to the terminal. Run the app by executing the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see a message indicating that the app is running. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the "Welcome to the Task Management App!" message.

## Implementing the Task Management Features

With the Flask app set up, we can now implement the task management features. Let's start by creating a database to store our tasks.

### Step 1: Set up a Database

For simplicity, we will use SQLite as our database. Add the following code to `app.py` to set up a connection to the database:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('tasks.db')
```

### Step 2: Create a Tasks Table

Next, let's create a table in the database to store our tasks. Add the following code to `app.py`:

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        title TEXT NOT NULL,
        description TEXT,
        due_date DATE,
        completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
    )
""")
conn.commit()
```

### Step 3: Implement Task CRUD Operations

Now that our database is set up, we can implement the task CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Add the following routes to `app.py`:

```python
@app.route('/tasks', methods=['GET'])
def get_tasks():
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM tasks ORDER BY due_date")
    tasks = cursor.fetchall()
    return f"List of tasks: {tasks}"

@app.route('/tasks', methods=['POST'])
def create_task():
    # Retrieve task data from request
    # Perform validation and insert into database
    return "Task created successfully"

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_task(task_id):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = ?", (task_id,))
    task = cursor.fetchone()
    return f"Task details: {task}"

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_task(task_id):
    # Retrieve task data from request
    # Perform validation and update corresponding task in database
    return f"Task {task_id} updated successfully"

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_task(task_id):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = ?", (task_id,))
    conn.commit()
    return f"Task {task_id} deleted successfully"
```

With these routes in place, our task management application is ready to use!

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have covered the process of building a task management application with Flask. We started by setting up a Flask environment, defining routes, and then implementing the task management features. You can further enhance this application by adding user authentication, improving the user interface, and integrating it with other services. Flask provides a solid foundation for building web applications, and with its flexibility and rich ecosystem, the possibilities are endless.
