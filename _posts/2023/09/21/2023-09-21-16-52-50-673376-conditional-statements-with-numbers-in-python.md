When working with numbers in Python, it is often necessary to use conditional statements to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. Conditional statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code only if a certain condition is true.

In Python, the most commonly used conditional statements are `if`, `else`, and `elif` (short for "else if"). These statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the use of conditional statements with numbers in Python:

```python
# Define a variable
x = 10

# Check if the number is positive or negative
if x > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("The number is negative")
else:
    print("The number is zero")
```

In the above example, we first define a variable `x` and assign it a value of 10. We then use conditional statements to check the value of `x`:

- If `x` is greater than 0 (`x > 0`), the program will print "The number is positive".
- If `x` is less than 0 (`x < 0`), the program will print "The number is negative".
- If neither of the above conditions is true, i.e., `x` is equal to 0, the program will print "The number is zero".

You can expand on this example by adding more conditions and statements to handle different scenarios based on the value of the number.

Remember to use meaningful variable names and provide clear comments in your code to improve readability and maintainability.
