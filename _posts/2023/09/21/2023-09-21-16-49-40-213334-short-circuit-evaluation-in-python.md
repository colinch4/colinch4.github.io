When writing conditional expressions in Python, you can take advantage of short-circuit evaluation to improve code efficiency. Short-circuit evaluation allows the interpreter to skip evaluating the second part of a boolean expression if the result can be determined based on the first part alone.

In Python, there are two operators that make use of short-circuit evaluation:

1. `and` operator: This operator returns the first operand if it is False, otherwise it returns the second operand.
2. `or` operator: This operator returns the first operand if it is True, otherwise it returns the second operand.

Let's see some examples to understand how short-circuit evaluation works:

```python
# Using the 'and' operator
x = 5
result = (x > 0) and (10 / x < 2)  # The second operand is not evaluated
print(result)  # Output: True

# Using the 'or' operator
y = 0
result = (y == 0) or (10 / y > 2)  # The second operand is not evaluated
print(result)  # Output: True
```

In the first example, the second operand of the `and` operator `10 / x < 2` is never evaluated because the first operand, `(x > 0)` is already False. This prevents any potential ZeroDivisionError that may occur if the second operand is evaluated.

Similarly, in the second example, the second operand of the `or` operator `10 / y > 2` is not evaluated because the first operand, `(y == 0)` is already True. This prevents another potential ZeroDivisionError.

Short-circuit evaluation can be especially useful when dealing with complex or computationally expensive expressions. By strategically placing the expressions that are less likely to evaluate to `True` or `False`, you can improve the performance of your code.

Remember, while short-circuit evaluation can be beneficial for efficiency, it is important to ensure that the expressions in your code do not have any side effects that are dependent on their evaluation.
