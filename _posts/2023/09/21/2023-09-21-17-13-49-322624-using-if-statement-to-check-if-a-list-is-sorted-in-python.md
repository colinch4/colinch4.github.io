# Using `if` statement to check if a list is sorted in Python

When working with lists in Python, it can be useful to check if a list is already sorted. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with large datasets or when writing algorithms that rely on sorted input. In this blog post, we will explore how to use an `if` statement to check if a list is sorted in Python.

## The `if` statement in Python

The `if` statement is a conditional statement in Python that allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. Its basic syntax looks like this:

```python
if condition:
    # execute this code if the condition is true
```

To check if a list is sorted, we can use the `if` statement and compare each element with the next element in the list. If all elements are in ascending order, the list is considered sorted.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use an `if` statement to check if a list is sorted in Python:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

# Test the function
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
if is_sorted(my_list):
    print("The list is sorted.")
else:
    print("The list is not sorted.")
```

In the code above, the function `is_sorted` takes a list as an input and iterates over each element of the list using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it compares each element with the next element using the `if` statement. If an element is greater than the next element, it means the list is not sorted, and the function returns `False`. If all elements pass the comparison, the function returns `True`.

In the example, the list `my_list` is checked using the `is_sorted` function, and the result is printed out based on whether the list is sorted or not.

## Conclusion

In Python, you can use an `if` statement to check if a list is sorted. By comparing each element with the next element, you can determine if the list is in ascending order. This can be useful when working with datasets that require sorted input or when designing algorithms that rely on sorted data.

Using the example code provided, you can easily incorporate this check into your own Python programs. Happy coding!
