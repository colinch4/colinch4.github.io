In Python, conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. One commonly used conditional operator is the less than operator (`<`), which compares two values and returns `True` if the first value is less than the second value, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example of using the less than operator in a conditional statement:

```python
age = 25

if age < 18:
    print("You are underage.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

In the above code, we first assign the value `25` to the variable `age`. We then use the less than operator (`<`) in the `if` statement to check if `age` is less than 18. If the condition is `True`, it prints "You are underage." Otherwise, it prints "You are an adult."

The less than operator can also be used with variables or expressions. Here's another example:

```python
x = 10
y = 20

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y.")
else:
    print("x is greater than or equal to y.")
```

In this code, we compare the values of `x` and `y` using the less than operator. If the condition `x < y` is `True`, it prints "x is less than y." Otherwise, it prints "x is greater than or equal to y."

You can also combine the less than operator with other conditional operators, such as the equal to operator (`==`), to create more complex conditions.

Remember, when using the less than operator in conditional statements, the comparison is based on the numerical value of the operands. If you're comparing strings, the comparison is based on the lexicographic order.

### Conclusion ###

The less than operator (`<`) is a powerful tool for comparing values in conditional statements in Python. It allows you to branch your code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. By understanding how to use the less than operator effectively, you can make your Python programs more versatile and responsive.
