Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. In this blog post, we will learn how to use the `if` statement to check if a given number is a prime number in Python.

## The concept of prime numbers

Before we dive into the code, let's understand the concept of prime numbers. A number is considered prime if it meets the following criteria:

1. It is greater than 1.
2. It is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are prime numbers.

## Using the `if` statement to check for prime numbers

We can use the `if` statement along with a loop to check if a given number is prime or not. Here's an example code in Python:

```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True

# Testing the function
print(is_prime(7))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(10))  # Output: False
```

In the code snippet above, we define a function `is_prime()` that takes the `number` as a parameter. We first check if the number is less than or equal to 1, as prime numbers must be greater than 1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, we return `False`.

Next, we iterate from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any integer in that range. If it is divisible, we know it's not a prime number and return `False`. If we exit the loop without finding any divisors, we return `True` as the number is prime.

Finally, we test the function with two sample numbers (`7` and `10`) and print the output.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we covered the concept of prime numbers and how to use the `if` statement to check if a given number is prime in Python. By understanding this code snippet, you can easily identify prime numbers in your projects or assignments. Remember, prime numbers are an important concept in number theory and have various applications in computer science and cryptography.
