```python
# Example list
my_list = [10, 27, 15, 35, 42]

# Check if a specific value exists in the list
if 15 in my_list:
    print("The value 15 is present in the list.")
else:
    print("The value 15 is not present in the list.")
```

In this code, we have a list called `my_list` that contains some numbers. We use the `in` operator to check if the value `15` is present in the list. If it is, we print a message indicating that the value is present. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that the value is not present.

Using an if statement in conjunction with the `in` operator allows us to easily check for specific values in a list in Python.
