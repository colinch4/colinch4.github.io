In Python, `None` is a special value that represents the absence of a value or the absence of a result. It is often used to indicate that a variable or a function has no assigned value or does not return any value.

When working with conditional statements in Python, you may need to check whether a variable is `None` or not. This can be done using an `if` statement.

Here's an example of a conditional statement with `None` value in Python:

```python
# Assign None to a variable
my_var = None

# Check if variable is None
if my_var is None:
    print("The variable is None.")
else:
    print("The variable is not None.")
```

In the above example, we first assign `None` to the variable `my_var`. Then, we use the `is` operator to check if `my_var` is `None`. If it is, we print "The variable is None.". Otherwise, we print "The variable is not None.".

Alternatively, you can also use the `==` operator to check if a variable is `None`:

```python
if my_var == None:
    print("The variable is None.")
else:
    print("The variable is not None.")
```

Both `is` and `==` can be used to check for `None` values, but using `is` is more concise and recommended in Python.

Remember to use `is` if you want to explicitly check for `None`, as `==` can have different behavior depending on the object being compared.
