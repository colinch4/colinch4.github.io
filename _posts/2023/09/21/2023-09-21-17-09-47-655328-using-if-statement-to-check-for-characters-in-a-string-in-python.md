In Python, you can use an `if` statement to check if a specific character or set of characters exists in a given string. This can be achieved by utilizing the `in` keyword in combination with the `if` statement. Let's look at an example to understand how this works.

```python
string = "Hello, World!"

# Check if the letter 'o' is present in the string
if 'o' in string:
    print("'o' is present in the string.")
else:
    print("'o' is not present in the string.")

# Check if the word 'World' is present in the string
if 'World' in string:
    print("'World' is present in the string.")
else:
    print("'World' is not present in the string.")
```

Output:
```
'o' is present in the string.
'World' is present in the string.
```

In the above example, we have a string variable `string` assigned with the value "Hello, World!". We use `if` statements to check if the character 'o' and the word 'World' exist in the string. If they do, their respective `print` statements will be executed, otherwise, the `else` block will be executed.

By using this approach, you can easily check for the presence of characters or words in a string and take appropriate actions based on the result.
