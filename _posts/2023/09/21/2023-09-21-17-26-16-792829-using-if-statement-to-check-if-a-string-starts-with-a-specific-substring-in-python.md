# Using If Statement to Check If a String Starts with a Specific Substring in Python

In Python, you can use an `if` statement to check if a string starts with a specific substring. This can be useful when you want to perform different actions based on whether a string meets certain criteria. Here's an example:

```python
# Define the string
string = "Hello, World!"

# Define the substring
substring = "Hello"

# Check if the string starts with the substring
if string.startswith(substring):
    print("The string starts with the substring.")
else:
    print("The string does not start with the substring.")
```

In the above code, we define a string variable named `string`, which contains the phrase "Hello, World!". We also define a substring variable named `substring`, which contains the word "Hello". We then use the `startswith()` method to check if the string starts with the substring. If it does, we print the message "The string starts with the substring." Otherwise, we print the message "The string does not start with the substring."

You can modify the values of the `string` and `substring` variables to check for different strings and substrings.

This technique can be helpful in various scenarios, such as validating user inputs, filtering data, or implementing specific logic based on the contents of a string.

# Conclusion

By using an `if` statement along with the `startswith()` method in Python, you can easily check if a string starts with a specific substring. This allows you to handle different cases or conditions based on the initial characters of a string.
