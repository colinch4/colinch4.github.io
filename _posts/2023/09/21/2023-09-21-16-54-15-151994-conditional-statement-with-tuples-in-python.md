Let's say we have a tuple called `person` which contains the name and age of a person:

```python
person = ("John", 25)
```

We can access the elements of the tuple using indexing. In this case, `person[0]` would give us the name "John" and `person[1]` would give us the age 25.

Now, let's consider a scenario where we want to display a message depending on the person's age. We can use an `if` statement to achieve this:

```python
if person[1] >= 18:
    print(f"{person[0]} is an adult.")
else:
    print(f"{person[0]} is a minor.")
```

In the above code, we are checking whether the person's age (accessed using `person[1]`) is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, we print a message stating that the person is an adult. Otherwise, we print a message stating that the person is a minor.

We can also use conditional statements with tuples in a more complex way. Consider the following example:

```python
person = ("Jane", 30, True)

name, age, is_student = person

if is_student:
    print(f"{name} is a student.")
elif age >= 18:
    print(f"{name} is an adult.")
else:
    print(f"{name} is a minor.")
```

In this case, our tuple `person` contains an additional boolean value indicating whether the person is a student. By unpacking the tuple into separate variables (`name`, `age`, `is_student`), we can use them in our conditional statements. 

Using conditional statements with tuples allows us to efficiently handle multiple values and make decisions based on different conditions. It is a powerful feature of Python that enables us to write clean and concise code.
