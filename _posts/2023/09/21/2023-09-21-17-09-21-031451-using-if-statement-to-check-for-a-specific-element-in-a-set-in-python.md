```python
# Create a set
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# Check if "banana" is present in the set
if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Banana is in the set")
else:
    print("Banana is not in the set")
```

In this example, we create a set called `fruits` which contains three elements: "apple", "banana", and "cherry". Then, we use an `if` statement to check if "banana" is present in the set. If it is, we print the message "Banana is in the set". If it's not, we print the message "Banana is not in the set".

Output:
```
Banana is in the set
```

This approach allows you to efficiently check for the existence of an element in a set before performing any further operations or logic based on its presence. The `in` keyword is used to check for membership in a set and returns `True` if the element is present, and `False` otherwise.

With this simple `if` statement, you can easily check for the presence of a specific element in a set in Python.
