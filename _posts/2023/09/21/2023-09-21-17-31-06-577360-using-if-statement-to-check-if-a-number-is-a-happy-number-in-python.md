# Using if statement to check if a number is a happy number in Python

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use an `if` statement in Python to check if a number is a happy number.

## What is a happy number?

A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

## Implementation

To check if a number is a happy number, we can follow the steps below:

1. Write a function, say `is_happy(num)`, that takes an integer `num` as input.
2. Initialize a `while` loop to keep iterating until `num` becomes 1 or we detect a cycle.
3. In each iteration, calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of `num` and assign the result back to `num`.
4. Check if `num` is equal to 1. If it is, return `True` as the number is a happy number.
5. Check if `num` is already present in a set of visited numbers. If it is, return `False` as this indicates a cycle and the number is not a happy number.
6. Add `num` to the set of visited numbers.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the loop breaks.

Here's the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def is_happy(num):
    visited = set()
    
    while num != 1 and num not in visited:
        visited.add(num)
        sum_of_squares = 0
        while num > 0:
            digit = num % 10
            sum_of_squares += digit ** 2
            num //= 10
        num = sum_of_squares
    
    return num == 1
```

## Usage

You can use the `is_happy(num)` function to check if a given number is a happy number. Here's an example:

```python
number = 19
if is_happy(number):
    print(f"{number} is a happy number!")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a happy number.")
```

Output:
```
19 is a happy number!
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use an `if` statement in Python to check if a number is a happy number. You can now apply this knowledge to identify happy numbers in your own programs and projects.

Be aware that this implementation has an O(log n) time complexity, where n is the given number. So, it should work efficiently for most input values.
