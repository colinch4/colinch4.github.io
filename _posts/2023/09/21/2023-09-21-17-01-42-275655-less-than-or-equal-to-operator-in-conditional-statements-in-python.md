Here's an example of how to use the less than or equal to operator in a conditional statement:

```python
age = 18

if age <= 18:
    print("You are eligible for a student discount.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible for a student discount.")

```
In this example, we have a variable `age` with a value of 18. The conditional statement checks if the value of `age` is less than or equal to 18. Since 18 is included in the eligible range, the output will be "You are eligible for a student discount."

You can also use the less than or equal to operator in other scenarios, such as comparing numerical values or sorting elements in a list.

Remember to use the appropriate data types when using the less than or equal to operator. For example, comparing strings or different data types may result in unexpected behavior.
