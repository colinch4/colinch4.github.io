```python
if condition:
    # code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # code to be executed if the condition is false
```

In the above code snippet, `condition` represents the expression that needs to be evaluated. If the condition is true, the code block nested under the `if` statement will be executed. On the other hand, if the condition is false, the code block nested under the `else` statement (optional) will be executed.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of `if` statements in Python:

```python
age = 25

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

In this example, we have a variable `age` assigned a value of 25. The `if` statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. Since 25 satisfies the condition, the code block under the `if` statement will execute, resulting in the output "You are eligible to vote."

It's important to note that the code block is indented with four spaces (or a tab) to indicate that it is part of the `if` statement. The indentation is crucial in Python as it determines the scope of the code and helps to maintain the structure of the program.

Understanding how to use `if` statements in Python is fundamental for implementing conditional logic in your code. It allows you to make decisions based on specific conditions, enabling your program to perform different actions based on those conditions.
