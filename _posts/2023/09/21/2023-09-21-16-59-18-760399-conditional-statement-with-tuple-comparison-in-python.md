In Python, you can use a conditional statement to compare tuples. Tuple comparison allows you to determine the relative order of tuples based on their elements.

The comparison of tuples is done element by element, starting from the first element. If the first elements of the tuples are equal, then the comparison moves to the second elements, and so on until a difference is found or all elements have been compared.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the use of a conditional statement with tuple comparison:

```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (1, 2, 4)

if tuple1 < tuple2:
    print("tuple1 is less than tuple2")
elif tuple1 > tuple2:
    print("tuple1 is greater than tuple2")
else:
    print("tuple1 and tuple2 are equal")
```

In this example, we have two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`. We compare the elements of the tuples using `<` and `>` operators within an `if` statement. The output of the comparison helps us determine the relative order of the tuples.

If `tuple1` is less than `tuple2`, the condition `tuple1 < tuple2` evaluates to `True`, and the corresponding message is printed. If `tuple1` is greater than `tuple2`, the condition `tuple1 > tuple2` evaluates to `True`, and a different message is printed. Finally, if both tuples are equal, none of the conditions are met, and the else block gets executed.

Keep in mind that when comparing tuples, the elements must be of a comparable data type. Otherwise, a `TypeError` will be raised.

Using conditional statements with tuple comparison can be helpful in various scenarios, such as sorting lists of tuples or implementing custom sorting logic based on specific tuple elements.
