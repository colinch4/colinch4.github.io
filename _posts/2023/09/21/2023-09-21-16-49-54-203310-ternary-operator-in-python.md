The syntax of the ternary operator in Python is:

```python
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

Here's an example to help illustrate how the ternary operator works:

```python
num = 10
result = "Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)  # Output: Even
```

In this code snippet, we use the ternary operator to check if `num` is divisible by 2. If it is, the value assigned to `result` is "Even"; otherwise, it is assigned "Odd". The result is then printed to the console.

The ternary operator can be more concise and readable than using an if-else statement, especially when the result is a simple value or expression. It is often used for assigning values to variables based on a condition or for returning values from functions.

However, it's important to use the ternary operator judiciously. If the condition or expressions are complex, it may be more readable to use regular if-else statements instead.

So, remember, the ternary operator in Python is a handy tool for writing concise conditional expressions, but use it wisely to maintain code readability and understandability.
