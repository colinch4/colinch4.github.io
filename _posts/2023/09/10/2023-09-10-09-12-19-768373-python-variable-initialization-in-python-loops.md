Let's start with the `for` loop. In Python, you can create a `for` loop that iterates over a sequence of elements using the `range()` function or by directly specifying the sequence. Now, let's discuss initializing variables inside a `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    x = i * 2
    print(x)
```

In the above example, the variable `x` is properly initialized inside the loop. With each iteration, `x` is re-initialized and takes on a new value. This means that the value of `x` in each iteration is independent of the previous iteration.

Now, let's take a look at a common mistake:

```python
x = 0

for i in range(5):
    x = i * 2
    print(x)
```

In the above example, the variable `x` is initialized before the loop. The mistake here is that in each iteration, the value of `x` is overwritten with a new value, instead of being incremented. As a result, only the final value of `x` is printed, which is `8` in this case. This is not what we typically expect from a loop.

Moving on to the `while` loop. In Python, a `while` loop will continue executing as long as a specified condition is `True`. Let's consider an example:

```python
i = 0

while i < 5:
    x = i * 2
    print(x)
    i += 1
```

In this example, we correctly initialize the variable `x` inside the loop. Similar to the `for` loop example, each iteration of the loop will re-initialize `x` with a new value. The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than `5`.

Remember, variable initialization inside loops is crucial for maintaining proper control flow and expected behavior of your code. By properly initializing variables within loops, you can avoid common mistakes and ensure your code runs as intended.
