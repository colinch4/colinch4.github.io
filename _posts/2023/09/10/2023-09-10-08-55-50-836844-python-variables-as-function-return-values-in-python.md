In Python, functions can return values that can be assigned to variables. This allows us to easily capture and work with the output of a function. This flexibility is one of the powerful features of Python programming.

## Returning a Single Value

To return a single value from a function, we use the `return` statement followed by the value we want to return. Let's consider a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

rectangle_area = calculate_area(5, 3)
print(rectangle_area)  # Output: 15
```

In the above example, the `calculate_area` function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`. It calculates the area by multiplying the given values and assigns it to the `area` variable. The `return` statement then sends the value of `area` back to the caller. The returned value is assigned to the `rectangle_area` variable, and we can use it later in our program.

## Returning Multiple Values

Python functions can also return multiple values by returning them as tuples. A tuple is an immutable sequence of elements. We can use tuple unpacking to assign the returned values to multiple variables.

```python
def calculate_dimensions(area):
    length = area // 5
    width = area % 5
    return length, width

rectangle_dimensions = calculate_dimensions(15)
length, width = rectangle_dimensions
print(length)  # Output: 3
print(width)  # Output: 0
```

In the above example, the `calculate_dimensions` function takes `area` as an argument and calculates the length and width of a rectangle depending on the given area. It uses the integer division `//` operator to calculate the length and the modulo `%` operator to calculate the width. The two values are then returned as a tuple. We assign the returned tuple to the `rectangle_dimensions` variable, and then use tuple unpacking to assign the values to the `length` and `width` variables.

## Conclusion

Using variables to capture function return values is a convenient way to work with the output of functions in Python. Whether you need to handle a single value or multiple values, Python offers a flexible and straightforward syntax for returning and assigning these values. This feature allows you to write cleaner and more modular code, enhancing the readability and maintainability of your programs.
