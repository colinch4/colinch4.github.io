```python
# This is a comment in Python

# Comments can be used to provide information about the purpose or functionality of the code:
# Calculate the sum of two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum)

# Comments can also be used to disable a certain line of code temporarily
# print("This line won't get executed")

"""
Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes.
This type of comment is often used for detailed explanations,
or to temporarily comment out multiple lines of code.
"""

# Another way to write a comment is to use the hash character(#) at the beginning of a line
# This is a single-line comment

Comments serve as useful reminders or explanations for both the readers and the writers of the code. They can help improve collaboration and make the code easier to understand and maintain. It is considered good practice to write clear and concise comments to assist anyone working with the code in the future.
