Let's start by creating a list of numbers:

```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
```

To find the average of these numbers, we need to calculate the sum of all the elements and divide it by the total number of elements in the list.

Here's the code to calculate the average:

```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
average = sum_numbers / len(numbers)

print("The average is:", average)
```

Output:
```
The average is: 15.0
```

In the code above, we use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all the elements in the list. Then, we divide it by the `len()` function, which returns the length or the total number of elements in the list. The result is stored in the `average` variable.

Finally, we use the `print()` function to display the average value.

You can try this code with your own list of numbers to find the average. Just modify the `numbers` list with your desired values.

This method works well for a list of numbers. However, keep in mind that if your list contains non-numeric elements, you may encounter type errors. So, make sure to handle such cases appropriately.

That's it! Now you know how to calculate the average of elements in a Python list using a simple method.
