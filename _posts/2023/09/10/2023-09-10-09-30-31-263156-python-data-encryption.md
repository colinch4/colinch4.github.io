Data encryption is a crucial aspect of modern-day technology. It involves encoding data to make it unreadable and unintelligible to unauthorized users. In Python, there are several methods available for data encryption. Let's explore some of the popular encryption techniques and how to implement them.

## 1. Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption, also known as secret key encryption, uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. The same key is shared between communicating parties. Here's an example of how to perform symmetric encryption using the **cryptography** module:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a random key
key = Fernet.generate_key()

# Create a Fernet cipher object
cipher = Fernet(key)

# Message to be encrypted
message = "Sensitive information"

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message.encode())

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message).decode()

print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
```

In the code above, we generate a random key using the `Fernet.generate_key()` method. Then we create a cipher object using the generated key. The message is encrypted using the `encrypt()` method and decrypted using the `decrypt()` method. Finally, we print the encrypted and decrypted messages.

## 2. Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses two different but mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be distributed to anyone, while the private key must be kept secure. Here's an example of how to perform asymmetric encryption using the **cryptography** module:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa, padding
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

# Generate a new RSA key pair
private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=2048,
    backend=default_backend()
)

# Get the public key
public_key = private_key.public_key()

# Message to be encrypted
message = b"Sensitive information"

# Encrypt the message using the public key
encrypted_message = public_key.encrypt(
    message,
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None
    )
)

# Decrypt the message using the private key
decrypted_message = private_key.decrypt(
    encrypted_message,
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None
    )
)

print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
```

In the code above, we generate a new RSA key pair using the `rsa.generate_private_key()` method. We then extract the public key from the generated private key using the `public_key()` method. The message is encrypted using the public key and decrypted using the private key. Finally, we print the encrypted and decrypted messages.

## Conclusion

Data encryption is essential for protecting sensitive information. In this blog post, we explored symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques in Python using the **cryptography** module. Both techniques have their own use cases, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of your application.
