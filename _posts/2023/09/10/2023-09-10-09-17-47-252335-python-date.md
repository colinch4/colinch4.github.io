In Python, handling dates and times is made easy with the `datetime` module. This module provides various classes and functions that allow you to work with dates and times effectively.

## Getting the Current Date

To retrieve the current date, you can use the `date` class from the `datetime` module. Here's a simple example:

```python
from datetime import date

current_date = date.today()
print("Current date:", current_date)
```

Output:
```
Current date: 2022-09-07
```

The `date.today()` method returns an instance of the `date` class representing the current local date. You can then manipulate this date object as needed.

## Formatting Dates

If you want to display the date in a specific format, you can use the `strftime()` method. This method allows you to format a date object as a string using directives.

Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import date

current_date = date.today()
formatted_date = current_date.strftime("%d-%m-%Y")
print("Formatted date:", formatted_date)
```

Output:
```
Formatted date: 07-09-2022
```

In the `strftime()` method, `%d` represents the day, `%m` represents the month, and `%Y` represents the year. You can combine these directives with other characters to create the desired date format.

## Manipulating Dates

The `datetime` module provides various methods for manipulating dates. For example, you can add or subtract days, months, or years from a date.

Here's an example that demonstrates date manipulation:

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta

current_date = date.today()
previous_date = current_date - timedelta(days=7)
next_date = current_date + timedelta(days=7)

print("Previous date:", previous_date)
print("Next date:", next_date)
```

Output:
```
Previous date: 2022-08-31
Next date: 2022-09-14
```

In the above example, we use the `timedelta` class to represent a duration or difference between two dates. We subtract 7 days from the current date to get the previous date, and add 7 days to get the next date.

## Conclusion

The `datetime` module in Python provides powerful tools for working with dates and times. You can easily retrieve the current date, format it as needed, and manipulate dates as per your requirements. This makes Python a great choice for date-related tasks in your projects.
