# Find the Maximum and Minimum Element in a Nested Tuple in python

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to find the maximum and minimum element in a nested tuple in Python.

## Problem Statement
Given a nested tuple, we need to find the maximum and minimum element present in it.

## Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We will define a function `find_max_min` that takes a nested tuple as input and returns the maximum and minimum element. 

1. Initialize the minimum value as positive infinity and the maximum value as negative infinity.
2. Iterate through each element in the tuple.
3. If the element is a tuple, recursively call the `find_max_min` function on it to find the maximum and minimum within that tuple.
4. If the element is not a tuple, compare it with the current minimum and maximum values and update them if necessary.
5. Return the final minimum and maximum values.

## Implementation

```python
def find_max_min(t):
    min_val = float('inf')
    max_val = float('-inf')
    
    for element in t:
        if isinstance(element, tuple):
            nested_min, nested_max = find_max_min(element)
            min_val = min(nested_min, min_val)
            max_val = max(nested_max, max_val)
        else:
            min_val = min(element, min_val)
            max_val = max(element, max_val)
    
    return min_val, max_val
```

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
t = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
min_val, max_val = find_max_min(t)
print(f"Min: {min_val}, Max: {max_val}")
```
Output:
```
Min: 1, Max: 6
```

### Example 2:
```python
t = ((10, 20), (-5, 0), (100, -200))
min_val, max_val = find_max_min(t)
print(f"Min: {min_val}, Max: {max_val}")
```
Output:
```
Min: -200, Max: 100
```

### Example 3:
```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, (-5, -10, (100, 200)))
min_val, max_val = find_max_min(t)
print(f"Min: {min_val}, Max: {max_val}")
```
Output:
```
Min: -10, Max: 200
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to find the maximum and minimum element in a nested tuple using a recursive approach in Python. This can be useful in situations where you need to process and analyze nested data structures.
