Let's start by understanding the basic concepts of tuples and lists in Python.

Tuples:
A tuple is an ordered, immutable sequence of elements. It is surrounded by parentheses and can contain any type of data, such as numbers, strings, or even other tuples.

Lists:
A list is an ordered, mutable sequence of elements. It is surrounded by square brackets and can also contain any type of data.

Now, let's dive into the code and see how we can convert a tuple into a list of strings. 

```python
# Define a tuple
my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# Converting tuple to list
my_list = list(my_tuple)

# Print the converted list
print(my_list)
```

In the above code, we have a tuple called `my_tuple` containing three string elements: 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry'. We use the `list()` function to convert the tuple into a list and assign it to `my_list`. Finally, we print the converted list using the `print()` function.

The output of the above code will be:

```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

As you can see, the tuple has been successfully converted into a list of strings.

You can also use a list comprehension to achieve the same result:

```python
# Define a tuple
my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# Converting tuple to list using list comprehension
my_list = [str(x) for x in my_tuple]

# Print the converted list
print(my_list)
```

In this code snippet, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the tuple and convert each element to a string using the `str()` function. This approach is concise and efficient, especially when dealing with larger tuples.

Now you know how to convert a tuple into a list of strings using Python. This knowledge can be particularly useful when you need to manipulate or modify the elements of a tuple that require mutable properties, which lists provide.
