In Python, there are several ways to find the product of elements in a list. The product of elements is the result of multiplying all the elements together.

### Method 1: Using a for loop

```python
def find_product(nums):
    product = 1
    for num in nums:
        product *= num
    return product

numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = find_product(numbers)
print(f"The product of {numbers} is {result}")
```

Output:
```
The product of [2, 3, 4, 5] is 120
```

In this method, we initialize a variable `product` to 1 and iterate over each element in the `nums` list. We then multiply the `product` by each element, one by one. Finally, we return the `product`.

### Method 2: Using `reduce()` function from `functools` module

```python
from functools import reduce
from operator import mul

numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = reduce(mul, numbers)
print(f"The product of {numbers} is {result}")
```

Output:
```
The product of [2, 3, 4, 5] is 120
```

In this method, we use the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module along with the `mul` function from the `operator` module. The `reduce()` function takes in two arguments - the function to apply (`mul`) and the list of numbers. It applies the function to the first two elements, then applies it to the result and the next element, and so on, until it has processed all elements in the list.

### Method 3: Using `numpy` library

```python
import numpy as np

numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
result = np.prod(numbers)
print(f"The product of {numbers} is {result}")
```

Output:
```
The product of [2, 3, 4, 5] is 120
```

In this method, we make use of the `numpy` library, which provides a `prod()` function to calculate the product of elements in an array. We pass the `numbers` list to the `np.prod()` function and store the result in the `result` variable.

These are three different ways to find the product of elements in a Python list. Depending on your specific use case, you can choose the method that best fits your needs.
