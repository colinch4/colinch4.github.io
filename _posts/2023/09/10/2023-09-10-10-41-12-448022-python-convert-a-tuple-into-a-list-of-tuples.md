## Method 1: Using a for loop

One way to convert a tuple into a list of tuples is by using a for loop. Here's an example that demonstrates this method:

```python
# Tuple that needs to be converted
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Empty list to hold the converted tuples
list_of_tuples = []

# Iterate over each element in the tuple
for element in my_tuple:
    # Convert single element tuple into a regular tuple
    converted_tuple = (element,)
    # Append the converted tuple to the list
    list_of_tuples.append(converted_tuple)

# Print the list of tuples
print(list_of_tuples)
```

Output:

```python
[(1,), (2,), (3,), (4,), (5,)]
```

This method creates an empty list called `list_of_tuples` and then iterates over each element in the original tuple. Each element is converted into a single element tuple using `(element,)` notation and then appended to the `list_of_tuples`. Finally, the resulting list of tuples is printed.

## Method 2: Using list comprehension

Another way to convert a tuple into a list of tuples is by using list comprehension. This method is more concise and Pythonic. Here's an example:

```python
# Tuple that needs to be converted
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# List comprehension to convert the tuple into a list of tuples
list_of_tuples = [(element,) for element in my_tuple]

# Print the list of tuples
print(list_of_tuples)
```

Output:

```python
[(1,), (2,), (3,), (4,), (5,)]
```

In this method, we use list comprehension to create a list of tuples directly. The `(element,)` notation is used to convert each element into a single element tuple. The resulting list of tuples is stored in the `list_of_tuples` variable and then printed.

Both methods achieve the same result - converting a tuple into a list of tuples. Which method you choose depends on your preference and the specific requirements of your program.
