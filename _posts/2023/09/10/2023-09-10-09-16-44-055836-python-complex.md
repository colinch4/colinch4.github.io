Python provides a built-in data type called `complex` for working with complex numbers. Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part and are commonly used in various mathematical calculations.

## Creating Complex Numbers

To create a complex number in Python, you can use the `complex()` function or by directly assigning values to the real and imaginary parts.

You can use the `complex()` function as follows:

```python
number = complex(3, 4)
print(number)  # Output: (3+4j)
```

Alternatively, you can create a complex number by assigning values to the real and imaginary parts:

```python
real = 2
imaginary = -5

number = real + imaginary * 1j
print(number)  # Output: (2-5j)
```

## Mathematical Operations with Complex Numbers

Python allows you to perform various mathematical operations with complex numbers. Let's go through a few examples:

### Addition and Subtraction

```python
num1 = complex(2, 3)
num2 = complex(4, -2)

sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2

print(sum_result)  # Output: (6+1j)
print(difference_result)  # Output: (-2+5j)
```

### Multiplication and Division

```python
num1 = complex(2, 3)
num2 = complex(4, -2)

multiplication_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

print(multiplication_result)  # Output: (14+2j)
print(division_result)  # Output: (-0.15384615384615385+0.8461538461538461j)
```

### Absolute Value and Conjugate

```python
number = complex(3, -4)

abs_value = abs(number)
conjugate = number.conjugate()

print(abs_value)  # Output: 5.0
print(conjugate)  # Output: (3+4j)
```

## Conclusion

Python's built-in `complex` data type allows you to work with complex numbers conveniently. You can create complex numbers, perform mathematical operations, and access their absolute values and conjugates. Incorporating complex numbers in your Python programs can help you solve complex mathematical problems efficiently.
