In Python, the namedtuple is a handy data structure that allows you to define lightweight, immutable data objects. It provides a way to create a class with named fields without explicitly defining a new class.

Namedtuples are defined using the collections module, which is part of the Python standard library. To use namedtuples, you need to import the collections module first:

```python
import collections
```

Creating a namedtuple is simple. You need to specify a name for the namedtuple and provide a list of field names. Each field name is separated by a comma. Here's an example:

```python
Coin = collections.namedtuple('Coin', ['denomination', 'year', 'country'])

penny = Coin('Penny', 1971, 'USA')
nickel = Coin('Nickel', 2005, 'Canada')
quarter = Coin('Quarter', 1987, 'USA')

print(penny)
print(nickel)
print(quarter)
```

In the above example, we create a Coin namedtuple with fields 'denomination', 'year', and 'country'. We then create three instances of the Coin namedtuple: penny, nickel, and quarter. Each instance is initialized with values for the fields.

When we print a namedtuple instance, it displays the field names along with their corresponding values:

```
Coin(denomination='Penny', year=1971, country='USA')
Coin(denomination='Nickel', year=2005, country='Canada')
Coin(denomination='Quarter', year=1987, country='USA')
```

Namedtuples behave like regular tuples, meaning their values cannot be modified once created. However, namedtuples provide a more convenient way to access their fields using dot notation:

```python
print(penny.denomination)  # Output: Penny
print(nickel.year)  # Output: 2005
print(quarter.country)  # Output: USA
```

Namedtuples also inherit several useful methods from tuples, such as indexing, slicing, and iterating over elements. Moreover, they provide the ability to access fields by index or name.

In conclusion, namedtuples are a powerful tool in Python for creating lightweight and immutable data objects with named fields. They are simple to use and provide convenient access to fields using dot notation. Consider using namedtuples when you need to work with structured data that doesn't require mutable operations.
