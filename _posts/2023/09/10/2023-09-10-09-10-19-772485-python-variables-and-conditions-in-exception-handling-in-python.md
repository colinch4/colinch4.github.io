Imagine a scenario where you need to divide two numbers but want to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception. Here's an example to demonstrate how you can handle this exception using variables and conditions:

```python
numerator = 10
denominator = 0

try:
    result = numerator / denominator

except ZeroDivisionError as error:
    print("Error:", error)
    valid_denominator = False

else:
    print("Result:", result)
    valid_denominator = True

if valid_denominator:
    # Continue with the rest of your code here
    pass
else:
    # Handle the invalid denominator case here
    pass
```

In the above code, we use the `try-except` block to attempt the division operation that might result in a ZeroDivisionError. If the division operation succeeds, the code inside the `else` block is executed, and `valid_denominator` is set to True. This indicates that the denominator is valid, allowing us to continue with the rest of the code.

However, if the division operation fails with a ZeroDivisionError, the code inside the `except` block is executed. Here, we print the error message and set `valid_denominator` to False. This flags that the denominator is not valid, allowing us to handle the exception accordingly.

Using the `valid_denominator` variable and the accompanying `if-else` condition, we can control the flow of the program based on whether the exception occurred or not.

By leveraging variables and conditions in exception handling, you can have more control over how your program behaves when certain exceptions occur. It enables you to handle exceptions in a specific way and ensure that your code continues to run smoothly.
