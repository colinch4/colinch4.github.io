CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a popular file format for storing and exchanging tabular data. It is widely used in data analysis, data manipulation, and data importing/exporting tasks. Python provides a built-in module `csv` for working with CSV files. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of reading and writing CSV files using the `csv` module in Python.

### Reading a CSV File

To read a CSV file in Python, we can utilize the `csv.reader` class. Here is an example of how to read a CSV file:

```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)

    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
```

In the above code snippet, we open the CSV file `data.csv` in read mode using the `open()` function. Then, we create a `csv_reader` object by passing the file object to the `csv.reader()` function. Later, we loop over each row in the CSV file and print it using a `for` loop.

### Writing to a CSV File

To write data to a CSV file in Python, we can use the `csv.writer` class. Here is an example of how to write data to a CSV file:

```python
import csv

data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['John Doe', '25', 'New York'],
    ['Jane Smith', '30', 'Los Angeles'],
    ['Alex Johnson', '27', 'Chicago']
]

with open('output.csv', 'w') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)

    for row in data:
        csv_writer.writerow(row)
```

In the above code snippet, we have a list of data that we want to write to a CSV file. We create a `csv_writer` object by passing the file object to the `csv.writer()` function. Then, we loop over each row in the `data` list and use the `writerow()` method to write each row to the CSV file.

### Reading and Writing CSV Files with Headers

When working with CSV files, it is common to have headers in the first row that describe the columns. The `csv` module provides a way to handle headers when reading and writing CSV files.

To read a CSV file with headers, we can use the `DictReader` class, which returns each row as a dictionary where the keys are the header names. Here is an example:

```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)

    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row['Name'], row['Age'], row['City'])
```

To write a CSV file with headers, we can use the `DictWriter` class, which requires a list of fieldnames as a parameter. Here is an example:

```python
import csv

data = [
    {'Name': 'John Doe', 'Age': '25', 'City': 'New York'},
    {'Name': 'Jane Smith', 'Age': '30', 'City': 'Los Angeles'},
    {'Name': 'Alex Johnson', 'Age': '27', 'City': 'Chicago'}
]

with open('output.csv', 'w') as file:
    fieldnames = ['Name', 'Age', 'City']
    csv_writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    csv_writer.writeheader()
    csv_writer.writerows(data)
```

In the above code snippets, we use `DictReader` and `DictWriter` classes to read and write CSV files with headers, respectively. The `writeheader()` method is used to write the header row in the output file.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored the basics of reading and writing CSV files in python using the `csv` module. We saw how to read a CSV file using the `csv.reader` class and write data to a CSV file using the `csv.writer` class. Additionally, we learned how to handle CSV files with headers using the `DictReader` and `DictWriter` classes.

Working with CSV files in Python is a fundamental skill for any data analyst or data engineer. The `csv` module provides a convenient and flexible way to handle data in this popular file format.
