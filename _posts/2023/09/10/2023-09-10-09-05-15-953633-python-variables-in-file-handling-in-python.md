File handling is an essential concept in programming, as it allows us to interact with files on our computer. Python provides us with a set of functions and methods that make it easy to work with files. In this article, we will explore how to use variables in file handling operations in Python.

## Reading from a File

To read from a file, we first need to open it using the `open()` function. We can assign the result of this function call to a variable. The `open()` function takes two parameters: the file name or path, and the mode in which we want to open the file. For example, to open a file named `data.txt` in read mode, we can do the following:

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
```

In the above code snippet, we assign the file object returned by `open()` to a variable called `file`. We can then use this variable to perform further operations on the file.

## Writing to a File

Similar to reading from a file, writing to a file also requires us to open it using the `open()` function. However, in this case, we need to specify the mode as "w" or "a", depending on whether we want to write to the file from scratch or append data to it.

To open a file in write mode, we can use the following code:

```python
file = open("data.txt", "w")
```

In the above code snippet, we assign the file object returned by `open()` to a variable called `file`. We can then write data to the file using the `write()` method of the file object.

## Closing a File

After we are done performing operations on a file, it is important to close it to free up system resources. To close a file, we can use the `close()` method of the file object. For example:

```python
file.close()
```

Once the file is closed, we can no longer read from or write to it.

## Example: Reading and Writing Variables to a File

Let's put all of this information together and see an example of reading and writing variables to a file:

```python
# Reading from a file
file = open("data.txt", "r")
name = file.readline()
age = int(file.readline())
file.close()

# Writing to a file
file = open("data.txt", "w")
file.write("John Doe\n")
file.write("25")
file.close()
```

In the above code, we first open the file in read mode and read the contents into two variables: `name` and `age`. We then close the file.

Next, we open the file again in write mode and write the variables `name` and `age` to the file. Finally, we close the file again.

By utilizing variables, we can conveniently read and write data to files in Python.

## Conclusion

Variables are an important part of file handling in Python as they allow us to store and manipulate data read from or written to a file. By understanding how to use variables in file handling operations, we can effectively work with files and perform various tasks.
