Here's an example to illustrate how to convert a list of strings into a tuple:

```python
# List of strings
my_list = ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']

# Convert list to tuple
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)

# Print the tuple
print(my_tuple)
```

The output of the above code will be:

```
('Hello', 'World', 'Python')
```

In the example above, we start with a list of strings `my_list` containing three elements. We then pass this list as an argument to the `tuple()` function, which converts it into a tuple. Finally, we print the resulting tuple.

It's worth mentioning that the `tuple()` function can be used with any iterable, not just lists. So, if you have a different type of iterable (e.g., set, dictionary keys, etc.), you can still use the `tuple()` function to convert it into a tuple.

Converting a list of strings into a tuple can be useful in various scenarios, such as when you need an immutable collection of strings or when you want to pass a collection of strings as an argument to a function that expects a tuple.

In conclusion, Python provides an easy way to convert a list of strings into a tuple using the `tuple()` function. By doing so, you can conveniently transform a mutable collection into an immutable one.
