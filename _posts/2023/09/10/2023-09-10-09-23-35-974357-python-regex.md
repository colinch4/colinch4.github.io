Regular expressions, also known as regex, are a powerful tool in Python for pattern matching and searching within strings. They allow you to define complex search patterns that can be used to validate, manipulate, or extract data from text.

In Python, the `re` module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions. Let's explore some common use cases and examples of regex in Python.

## Basic Pattern Matching

To perform a basic pattern matching using regex, you need to compile a pattern and apply it to a string using the `re.search()` function. Here's an example:

```python
import re

# Define a pattern
pattern = r"apple"

# Define a string to search
text = "I have an apple"

# Search for the pattern in the string
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Pattern found!")
else:
    print("Pattern not found!")
```

In this example, the pattern "apple" is searched within the string "I have an apple". If the pattern is found, it will print "Pattern found!". Otherwise, it will print "Pattern not found!".

## Extracting Data

One of the powerful features of regular expressions is the ability to extract specific data from strings. You can use capturing groups to specify parts of the pattern that you want to extract. Here's an example:

```python
import re

# Define a pattern with capturing groups
pattern = r"(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})"

# Define a string containing a date
text = "Today's date is 22-07-2022"

# Extract the date using the pattern
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    day = match.group(1)
    month = match.group(2)
    year = match.group(3)
    print(f"Day: {day}, Month: {month}, Year: {year}")
else:
    print("Date not found!")
```

In this example, the pattern `(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})` matches a date in the format DD-MM-YYYY. The capturing groups `(\d{2})`, `(\d{2})`, and `(\d{4})` extract the day, month, and year respectively. The extracted values are then printed.

## Substitution

Regex can also be used for string substitution. The `re.sub()` function allows you to search for a pattern in a string and replace it with a specified replacement string. Here's an example:

```python
import re

# Define a pattern to search for
pattern = r"apple"
replacement = "orange"

# Define a string
text = "I have an apple"

# Replace the pattern with the replacement string
new_text = re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)

print(new_text)  # Output: "I have an orange"
```

In this example, the pattern "apple" is replaced with the string "orange" in the given text. The resulting string is then printed.

These are just a few examples of how you can use regex in Python. Regular expressions offer a wide range of features and functionality for pattern matching. It's worth exploring the `re` module documentation to discover more advanced patterns and techniques.

Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately when working with regular expressions, as incorrect patterns can result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Happy regex matching!
