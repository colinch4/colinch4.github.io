Fortunately, Python provides a straightforward way to count occurrences using the `count()` method. Let's see how it works with an example.

```python
# Define a list of fruits
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'apple']

# Count the occurrences of 'apple'
apple_count = fruits.count('apple')

# Print the result
print(f"The count of 'apple' is: {apple_count}")
```

In the above code snippet, we have a list `fruits` with various elements. We want to count the occurrences of the string `'apple'` in the list using the `count()` method. 

The `count()` method takes an element as an argument and returns the number of times that element appears in the list. In this case, it returns the count of the string `'apple'`.

Finally, we print the result using an f-string, displaying the count of `'apple'`.

Output:
```
The count of 'apple' is: 3
```

It's important to note that the `count()` method counts the exact occurrences of the specified element. It does not consider variations in case or partial matches. For example, `'Apple'` or `'ap'` would not be counted in our example of counting `'apple'`.

Now that you know how to count the occurrences of an element in a Python list, you can apply this knowledge to various scenarios in your projects or programs.
