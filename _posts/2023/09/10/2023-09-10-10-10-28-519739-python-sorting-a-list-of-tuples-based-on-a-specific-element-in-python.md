Here's an example code that demonstrates how to sort a list of tuples based on a specific element:

```python
# Define a list of tuples
data = [('John', 30), ('Emma', 25), ('Adam', 35), ('Sophia', 28)]

# Sort the list of tuples based on the second element in each tuple
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])

# Print the sorted list
print(sorted_data)
```

The output of the above code will be:

```python
[('Emma', 25), ('Sophia', 28), ('John', 30), ('Adam', 35)]
```

In this example, we have a list of tuples representing names and ages. By passing a lambda function as the `key` argument to `sorted()`, we specify that the sorting should be based on the second element of each tuple (`x[1]`). The `sorted()` function then rearranges the list in ascending order of the specified element.

You can also sort the list in descending order by specifying the `reverse` argument as `True`:

```python
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

This will give you the following output:

```python
[('Adam', 35), ('John', 30), ('Sophia', 28), ('Emma', 25)]
```

In this example, the list is sorted in descending order of the second element of each tuple.

By using the `key` argument, you can easily sort a list of tuples based on a specific element in Python, allowing for flexibility in sorting data structures.
