Loops are an essential part of programming as they allow us to repeat a certain block of code multiple times. In Python, we have two types of loops: `for` and `while` loops.

## `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects. It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

Here is the general syntax of a `for` loop in Python:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # code block to be executed
```

Let's look at a simple example to understand how the `for` loop works:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Output:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

In the code above, we have a list of fruits. The `for` loop iterates over each item in the `fruits` list, and the code block inside the loop (indented) is executed for each item. The `fruit` variable takes the value of each item in the list during each iteration, and we print its value.

## `while` Loop

The `while` loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It is generally used when we don't know beforehand how many times the loop needs to be executed.

Here is the general syntax of a `while` loop in Python:

```python
while condition:
    # code block to be executed
```

Let's see an example of a simple `while` loop in Python:

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In the code above, we initialize a variable `count` with the value 0. The `while` loop continues executing the code block until the condition `count < 5` becomes false. In each iteration, we print the current value of `count` and increment it by 1.

## `break` and `continue` Statements

Within loops, we can also use the `break` and `continue` statements to control the flow of execution.

- The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. It terminates the loop and moves to the next statement following the loop.
- The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code within the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of both `break` and `continue` statements within a loop:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for number in numbers:
    if number == 5:
        break             # exit the loop when number equals 5
    elif number % 2 == 0:
        continue          # skip the even numbers
    
    print(number)
```

Output:
```
1
3
```

In the code above, we have a list of numbers. The `for` loop iterates over each number in the list. If the number is equal to 5, the loop is exited with the `break` statement. If the number is even, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code block, and the loop moves on to the next iteration. Hence, only odd numbers are printed.

Loops are powerful constructs that enable us to automate repetitive tasks in our code. By understanding how to use `for` and `while` loops, along with the `break` and `continue` statements, we can write more efficient and flexible programs in Python.
