In Python, the `range()` function is commonly used to generate a sequence of numbers. It is a built-in function that returns an immutable **sequence object** of numbers between the given start and stop values, incremented by a specified step.

The syntax of the `range()` function is as follows:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

- `start`: The inclusive lower limit of the range (default value is 0 if not specified).
- `stop`: The exclusive upper limit of the range. The created sequence will contain all numbers from `start` up to, but not including, `stop`.
- `step`: The difference between each number in the sequence (default value is 1 if not specified).

The `range()` function can be used in various scenarios. Let's take a look at some examples:

## 1. Generating a sequence of numbers

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

This code snippet will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (exclusive). It will then iterate over each number and print it.

## 2. Creating a range with a specified step

```python
for num in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
0
2
4
6
8
```

In this example, the `range()` function is used with a `start` value of 0, `stop` value of 10, and a `step` value of 2. This will create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10 (exclusive), incremented by 2.

## 3. Converting range to a list

You can also convert a range object to a list using the `list()` function. Here's an example:

```python
numbers = list(range(1, 6))
print(numbers)
```

Output:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this case, the `range()` function is used to create a range from 1 to 6 (exclusive), and then the `list()` function converts it to a list.

With the `range()` function, you have flexibility in generating sequential numbers with varying start, stop, and step values. It is a powerful tool in Python that simplifies tasks that require iterating over a sequence of numbers.
