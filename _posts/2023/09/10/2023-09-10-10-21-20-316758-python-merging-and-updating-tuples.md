# Merging Tuples
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
merged_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
print(merged_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Updating Tuples
tuple3 = (7, 8, 9)
updated_tuple = tuple3 + (10,)
print(updated_tuple)  # Output: (7, 8, 9, 10)
```

In Python, tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified directly. However, there are ways to merge or update tuples to create a new tuple.

### Merging Tuples
To merge two or more tuples, you can simply use the `+` operator. This operator concatenates the elements of the tuples and returns a new tuple with the combined elements. The original tuples remain unchanged.

In the example code above, `tuple1` and `tuple2` are merged using the `+` operator into `merged_tuple`. The output of the `print` statement is `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`, which shows that the elements from both tuples are merged into a single tuple.

### Updating Tuples
Updating a tuple involves creating a new tuple with additional elements. Since tuples are immutable, you cannot directly add or modify elements in a tuple. However, you can create a new tuple by concatenating the original tuple with another tuple containing the new element(s).

In the example code above, `tuple3` is updated by adding the element `10` to create `updated_tuple`. The `+` operator is used to concatenate `tuple3` with the tuple `(10,)`. Note the comma after `10` within parentheses - this makes it a single-element tuple. The output of the `print` statement is `(7, 8, 9, 10)`, indicating that the tuple has been updated with the additional element.

By merging and updating tuples in Python, you can easily create new tuples with the desired elements without modifying the original tuples. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as combining data from multiple sources or updating existing data structures.
