Data-driven testing is a popular approach in software testing where test cases are designed and executed based on input data from external sources. In Python, we can easily implement data-driven testing using libraries like `pytest` and `pandas`. Let's dive into how to perform data-driven testing in Python using these libraries.

## Setup

First, let's install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```shell
pip install pytest pandas
```

## Creating Test Data

To perform data-driven testing, we need to create a test data source. This can be a CSV file, Excel spreadsheet, or any other tabular format. For simplicity, let's use a CSV file named `test_data.csv`:

```csv
input1,input2,expected_result
1,2,3
4,5,9
10,5,15
```

## Writing Test Cases

In this example, we will create a `test_data_driven.py` file to define our test cases. We will use `pytest` to write our test cases. Start by importing the necessary packages:

```python
import pytest
import pandas as pd
```

Next, we will define our test function that takes input values from the test data and asserts the expected result. We can use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to pass test data from our CSV file to the test function:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input1, input2, expected_result", pd.read_csv("test_data.csv").values)
def test_addition(input1, input2, expected_result):
    assert input1 + input2 == expected_result
```

## Running the Tests

To execute the test cases, open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `test_data_driven.py` and `test_data.csv`. Run the following command:

```shell
pytest test_data_driven.py
```

Pytest will automatically discover and execute the test cases defined in `test_data_driven.py`. You should see the test results in the terminal.

## Conclusion

Data-driven testing is a powerful technique that allows us to efficiently test our code using a variety of input data. In this tutorial, we learned how to perform data-driven testing in Python using `pytest` and `pandas`.

Remember to always validate input data and handle any exceptions or edge cases that may arise. Happy testing!
