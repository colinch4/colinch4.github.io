ThriftPy is a powerful Python library for implementing Thrift clients and servers. It allows for efficient communication between different languages and platforms. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement bi-directional communication using ThriftPy.

## What is bi-directional communication?

Bi-directional communication refers to the ability for both the client and server to send messages to each other. In traditional client-server communication, the client sends a request to the server and waits for a response. However, in some scenarios, it is necessary for the server to send messages to the client without any prior request.

## Implementing bi-directional communication with ThriftPy

To implement bi-directional communication with ThriftPy, we need to use the `TTransport` interface provided by the library. This interface allows us to customize the transport layer used for communication.

Here is an example of how to implement bi-directional communication using ThriftPy:

```python
from thrift.transport import TTransport
from thrift.transport import TSocket
from thrift.transport.TTransport import TTransportException
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from my_thrift_service import MyThriftService

# Create a socket connection to the server
socket = TSocket.TSocket("localhost", 9090)
transport = TTransport.TFramedTransport(socket)
protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)

# Create a Thrift client
client = MyThriftService.Client(protocol)

# Open the transport connection
transport.open()

# Start a separate thread to listen for server messages
def receive_messages():
    while True:
        try:
            message = client.get_message()
            print("Received message from server:", message)
        except TTransportException:
            break

# Start the thread to receive messages
receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive_messages)
receive_thread.start()

# Send a request to the server
response = client.send_request("Hello, server!")

# Close the transport connection
transport.close()
```

In the above example, we first create a socket connection to the server using `TSocket`. We then wrap the socket connection with `TFramedTransport` to enable reliable transport of messages. Next, we create a `TBinaryProtocol` to serialize and deserialize Thrift messages.

After establishing the connection, we start a separate thread to continuously listen for server messages using the `get_message()` method provided by the Thrift client. We can then process these messages as needed.

Finally, we can send a request to the server using the `send_request()` method provided by the Thrift client. The response from the server can be handled accordingly.

## Conclusion

Bi-directional communication is essential in certain scenarios where the server needs to send messages to the client without any prior request. ThriftPy provides the necessary tools and interfaces to implement bi-directional communication efficiently. By properly utilizing the `TTransport` interface, we can create robust and feature-rich applications using ThriftPy.
