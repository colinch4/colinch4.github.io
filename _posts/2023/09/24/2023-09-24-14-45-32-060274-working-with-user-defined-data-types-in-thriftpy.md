In this blog post, we will explore how to work with user-defined data types in ThriftPy, focusing on the steps to define and use these types effectively.

## Defining User-Defined Data Types

To define a user-defined data type in ThriftPy, you need to use the Thrift IDL (Interface Definition Language). This language allows you to describe the structure and properties of your data types in a platform-independent manner.

Let's consider an example where we want to define a `Person` data type with `name` and `age` fields. We can define this in a `.thrift` file, say `example.thrift`, as follows:

```thrift
namespace py example

struct Person {
    1: required string name,
    2: required i32 age,
}
```

Here, we define a `Person` struct with two fields: `name` of type `string` and `age` of type `i32` (32-bit signed integer). The `required` keyword denotes that these fields are mandatory.

## Generating Python Code

After defining your data types in a `.thrift` file, you need to generate the corresponding Python code. To do this, you can use the `thrift` command-line tool or a build script. Assuming you have the Thrift installation set up, the following command generates the Python code for the example:

```bash
thrift --gen py example.thrift
```

This command produces a `gen-py` folder containing the generated Python code. You can now import and use these generated modules in your Python application.

## Working with User-Defined Data Types

To use the user-defined data types in your Python application, follow these steps:

1. Import the generated modules for your data types:
```python
from example import ExampleService, Person
```
2. Create instances of your data types and populate the fields:
```python
person = Person()
person.name = "John Doe"
person.age = 25
```
3. Use the data types in your Thrift service operations:
```python
client = ExampleService.Client(transport, protocol)
client.addPerson(person)
```

By following these steps, you can effectively work with user-defined data types in ThriftPy. Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately when working with Thrift services.

#Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to work with user-defined data types in ThriftPy. We discussed the steps to define these types in the Thrift IDL and generate Python code using the Thrift command-line tool. Finally, we outlined the steps to use user-defined data types in a Python application, including importing the generated modules and working with instances of the data types. With this knowledge, you can leverage ThriftPy to build scalable and efficient distributed systems.
