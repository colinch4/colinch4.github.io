Thrift is a powerful framework for developing scalable and efficient services. One of the challenges that developers face when using Thrift is managing versioning. Versioning becomes crucial when you need to make changes to your Thrift schema while ensuring backward compatibility for existing clients.

ThriftPy, a Python library for Apache Thrift, offers several techniques to handle versioning effectively. In this blog post, we will explore some of these techniques and how they can be used in your ThriftPy applications.

## 1. Adding Optional Fields

One simple approach to handle versioning is by adding optional fields to your Thrift structs. By marking fields as optional, you can add new fields to the struct without breaking the backward compatibility for existing clients.

```python
struct User {
  1: required i32 id,
  2: required string name,
  3: optional string email,
  4: optional string address,
}
```

In the above example, the `email` and `address` fields are optional, allowing new fields to be added without affecting older clients that do not rely on these fields.

## 2. Using Default Values

Another way to manage versioning is by using default values for new fields. This ensures that even if a new field is not provided by the client, a sensible default value will be used by the server.

```python
struct User {
  1: required i32 id,
  2: required string name,
  3: string email = "N/A",
  4: string address = "N/A",
}
```

By assigning default values to the `email` and `address` fields, older clients without knowledge of these fields will receive the default values when interacting with the updated server.

## Conclusion

Managing versioning in ThriftPy is essential to maintain backward compatibility while making schema changes. By adding optional fields or using default values, you can introduce changes without breaking existing clients.

It's crucial to communicate any schema changes to the client developers and provide clear documentation on the versioning strategy employed in your ThriftPy services.

Using these versioning techniques, you can enhance your ThriftPy applications and ensure a smooth transition for both existing and new clients.
