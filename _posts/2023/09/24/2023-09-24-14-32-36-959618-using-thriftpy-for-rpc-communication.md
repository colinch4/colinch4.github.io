With the increasing need for efficient and fast communication between different components in a distributed system, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) has become a popular choice in modern software development. In this blog post, we will explore how we can leverage **ThriftPy** to implement RPC communication in our applications.

## What is ThriftPy?

**ThriftPy** is a Python library that provides an implementation of the Apache Thrift protocol. Apache Thrift is an open-source framework used for cross-language RPC communication, allowing different services to communicate seamlessly regardless of the programming language they are implemented in.

ThriftPy provides a simple and straightforward way to define services and data structures using a Thrift IDL (Interface Definition Language) file. It then generates the necessary code to handle the communication between the client and the server for these defined services.

## Getting Started

To get started with ThriftPy, you need to install the library by running the following command:

```bash
pip install thrift
```

Once you have ThriftPy installed, you can define your RPC services and data structures using a Thrift IDL file. For example, let's say we want to create a simple service for retrieving weather information.

```thrift
namespace py example.weather

struct Location {
    1: required string city
    2: optional string country
}

service WeatherService {
    bool ping()
    string getTemperature(1: Location location)
}
```

In the above Thrift IDL file, we define a `Location` struct with `city` and `country` attributes, and a `WeatherService` service with two methods: `ping` and `getTemperature`.

Once you have defined your Thrift IDL file, you can generate the Python code using the `thrift` compiler:

```bash
thrift -r --gen py weather_service.thrift
```

This will generate the necessary Python code to implement the defined services and data structures. You can then start implementing the server and client code using the generated classes.

## Implementing the Server

To implement the server, you need to create a server class that extends the generated `WeatherService` class and implements the defined methods. Here's an example of how to implement the server:

```python
from thrift.transport import TSocket
from thrift.transport import TTransport
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.server import TServer

from example.weather import WeatherService


class WeatherServiceImpl(WeatherService.Iface):
    def ping(self):
        return True

    def getTemperature(self, location):
        # Real implementation goes here
        return "25Â°C"


def main():
    handler = WeatherServiceImpl()
    processor = WeatherService.Processor(handler)
    transport = TSocket.TServerSocket(port=9090)
    tfactory = TTransport.TBufferedTransportFactory()
    pfactory = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocolFactory()

    server = TServer.TSimpleServer(processor, transport, tfactory, pfactory)

    server.serve()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the example above, we create a `WeatherServiceImpl` class that extends the generated `WeatherService.Iface` and implements both the `ping` and `getTemperature` methods.

We then create the necessary server objects such as the transport, processor, and protocol factories. Finally, we create an instance of `TSimpleServer` and start serving the requests.

## Implementing the Client

To implement the client, you can use the generated `WeatherService.Client` class to make remote procedure calls to the server. Here's an example of how to implement the client:

```python
from thrift.transport import TSocket
from thrift.transport import TTransport
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol

from example.weather import WeatherService


def main():
    transport = TSocket.TSocket('localhost', 9090)
    transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)
    protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)

    client = WeatherService.Client(protocol)
    transport.open()

    if client.ping():
        location = WeatherService.Location(city="New York", country="USA")
        temperature = client.getTemperature(location)
        print(f"The temperature in New York is {temperature}")

    transport.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the example above, we create the necessary client objects such as the transport and protocol. We then create an instance of `WeatherService.Client` using the protocol.

We open the transport connection, make the remote procedure calls, and finally close the transport connection.

## Conclusion

ThriftPy provides a convenient and efficient way to implement RPC communication in your Python applications. By using **ThriftPy**, you can easily define services and data structures using a Thrift IDL file and generate the necessary code to handle the communication between the client and the server.

By leveraging **ThriftPy**, you can build scalable and cross-language applications with ease.
