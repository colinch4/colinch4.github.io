Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. Traditionally, sentiment analysis has been performed solely on textual data. However, with the advent of multimodal data, which includes both textual and visual information, there is an increasing interest in performing sentiment analysis using multiple modalities.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform multi-modal sentiment analysis in NLP using Python. We will utilize both textual and visual information to enhance the sentiment analysis task. Let's get started!

## Gathering Data

The first step in any machine learning task is to gather the necessary data. For multi-modal sentiment analysis, we need a dataset that includes both textual and visual information along with their corresponding sentiment labels. One such dataset is the "MOSI" (Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis) dataset, which contains videos annotated with sentiment labels.

To access the MOSI dataset, we will use the `torchmoji` library, which is a Python library for deep learning-based sentiment analysis. You can install the library using the following command:

```
pip install torchmoji
```

## Preprocessing Textual Data

Once we have the dataset, we need to preprocess the textual data before feeding it into our sentiment analysis model. This involves steps like tokenization, normalizing text, removing stop words, and so on. We can achieve this using the `nltk` library, which is a popular library for natural language processing in Python. Here's an example of how to preprocess textual data using `nltk`:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words('english')]
    return tokens
```

## Extracting Visual Features

In addition to textual data, we can extract visual features from the video frames to capture the visual cues related to sentiment. We can use pre-trained deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features. The `torchvision` library in PyTorch provides pre-trained CNN models that we can use for this purpose. Here's an example of how to extract visual features using `torchvision`:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

def extract_visual_features(image):
    model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
    modules = list(model.children())[:-1]
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(*modules)
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406), (0.229, 0.224, 0.225))
    ])
    image = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
    features = model(image)
    return features.flatten().tolist()
```

## Building the Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis Model

Now that we have preprocessed textual data and extracted visual features, we can build the multi-modal sentiment analysis model. We can use deep learning architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers to combine the textual and visual information and make sentiment predictions. There are several approaches to integrating multimodal data, such as early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion.

For simplicity, let's consider the late fusion approach, where we concatenate the textual and visual features and feed them into a fully connected neural network. Here's an example of how to build the multi-modal sentiment analysis model using the `torch` library:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiModalSentimentAnalysisModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, text_feature_size, visual_feature_size, hidden_size):
        super(MultiModalSentimentAnalysisModel, self).__init__()
        self.text_layer = nn.Linear(text_feature_size, hidden_size)
        self.visual_layer = nn.Linear(visual_feature_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, text_features, visual_features):
        text_output = self.text_layer(text_features)
        visual_output = self.visual_layer(visual_features)
        fused_features = torch.cat((text_output, visual_output), dim=1)
        predictions = self.fc(fused_features)
        return predictions
```

## Training and Evaluating the Model

Once the model is built, we can train it on the multi-modal dataset and evaluate its performance. We can use techniques like cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. Here's an example of how to train and evaluate the multi-modal sentiment analysis model:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

def train(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for text_features, visual_features, labels in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            predictions = model(text_features, visual_features)
            loss = criterion(predictions, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

def evaluate(model, test_loader):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        correct = 0
        total = 0
        for text_features, visual_features, labels in test_loader:
            predictions = model(text_features, visual_features)
            _, predicted_labels = torch.max(predictions.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted_labels == labels).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct / total
        return accuracy
```
