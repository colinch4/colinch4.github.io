1. Lowercasing:
One of the simplest preprocessing steps is to convert all text to lowercase. This is important because it helps standardize the text and ensures that words are treated as the same regardless of their casing. In Python, you can use the `lower()` method to convert all text to lowercase.

```python
text = "Hello World"
lower_text = text.lower()
print(lower_text)
```
Output:
```
hello world
```

2. Tokenization:
Tokenization involves breaking down a text into individual words or tokens. This is a fundamental step as it provides the basis for further analysis and feature extraction. The `nltk` library in Python provides various tokenization methods. Here, we will use word tokenization.

```python
import nltk

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```
Output:
```
['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
```

3. Stop Word Removal:
Stop words are common words that do not carry much meaning in a text, such as "a", "the", "is", etc. Removing these words can help reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve model performance. The `nltk` library provides a predefined list of stop words that can be used for removal.

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

tokens = ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_tokens)
```
Output:
```
['quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'lazy', 'dog']
```

4. Lemmatization:
Lemmatization involves reducing words to their base or root form. This is useful for reducing inflectional forms and treating different word forms as the same. The `nltk` library provides a WordNet lemmatizer that can be used for this purpose.

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
words = ["running", "jumped", "dogs"]
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
print(lemmatized_words)
```
Output:
```
['running', 'jumped', 'dog']
```

These are some of the basic text preprocessing techniques that can be used in NLP tasks. Depending on the specific task and dataset, additional preprocessing steps such as removing punctuation, handling special characters, or handling numerical data may be required.
