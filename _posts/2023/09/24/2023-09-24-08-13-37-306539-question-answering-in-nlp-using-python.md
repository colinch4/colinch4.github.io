As natural language understanding and processing (NLP) continues to advance, the ability to build question answering systems has become more accessible. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of question answering in NLP using Python.

## What is Question Answering?

Question answering is the task of automatically answering questions asked in natural language. It involves understanding the question, searching for relevant information, and generating a concise and accurate answer.

## Implementing Question Answering with Python

To implement question answering, we can use a combination of pre-trained language models and information retrieval techniques. Here, we will use the **transformers** library and the **Haystack** framework in Python.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

We need to install two libraries: **transformers** and **haystack**. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers haystack
```

### Step 2: Preprocess Documents

In order to answer questions, we need a collection of documents to search through. We will start by preprocessing these documents so that they can be easily searched.

```python
from haystack.preprocessor.cleaning import clean_wiki_text

# preprocess a document
def preprocess_document(doc):
    doc = clean_wiki_text(doc)
    return doc
```

### Step 3: Create Document Store

The document store will hold our preprocessed documents. We will use Elasticsearch as our document store.

```python
from haystack.document_store.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchDocumentStore

# create Elasticsearch document store
document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore(
    host="localhost",
    username="",
    password="",
    index="question_answering_example"
)
```

### Step 4: Add Documents to Document Store

We can now add preprocessed documents to the document store.

```python
from haystack.indexing.utils import write_documents_to_db

# add documents to Elasticsearch document store
documents = [
    {"text": "The sky is blue."},
    {"text": "The grass is green."},
    {"text": "The sun is shining."},
]
write_documents_to_db(document_store=document_store, documents=documents)
```

### Step 5: Initialize a Retriever

A retriever helps us to quickly find the most relevant documents based on a search query. We will use the **TfidfRetriever** for this example.

```python
from haystack.retriever.sparse import TfidfRetriever

# initialize TfidfRetriever
retriever = TfidfRetriever(document_store=document_store)
```

### Step 6: Initialize Reader

The reader applies a specific model to find the answer to a question given the relevant documents. We will use the **TransformerReader** for this example.

```python
from haystack.reader.transformers import TransformersReader

# initialize TransformerReader
reader = TransformersReader(model_name_or_path="distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad")
```

### Step 7: Ask Questions

With our retriever and reader in place, we can now ask questions and find the answers.

```python
# ask a question
question = "What color is the sky?"
prediction = pipeline.run(query=question, top_k_retriever=5, top_k_reader=1)

# print the answer
print(prediction['answers'][0]['answer'])
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to build a question answering system using Python. We learned about the steps involved, from preprocessing the documents to using pre-trained models for retrieval and reading. Implementing question answering systems opens up a wide range of possibilities for NLP applications, such as chatbots, customer support, and knowledge base search.
