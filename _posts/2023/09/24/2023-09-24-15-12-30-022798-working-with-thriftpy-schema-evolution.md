Schema evolution is an important aspect of working with Apache Thrift, which enables you to make changes to the schema of your data without disrupting the compatibility with existing clients and servers. ThriftPy, a Python implementation of Apache Thrift, also supports schema evolution.

In this blog post, we will explore how to work with schema evolution using ThriftPy and discuss some best practices to ensure smooth schema evolution in your applications.

## Understanding Schema Evolution

Schema evolution refers to the process of making changes to the schema of your Thrift data structures while still maintaining compatibility with existing code. These changes can include adding or removing fields, changing field types, or modifying field names.

When performing schema evolution, it is essential to consider both the producing (server) side and consuming (client) side of the data. The server must be able to handle requests from older clients that may not have the updated schema, while clients should be able to parse responses from newer servers with additional or modified fields.

## Best Practices for Schema Evolution

To ensure smooth schema evolution, here are some best practices you can follow:

1. **Versioning your Thrift structures**: Maintain a version number for your Thrift structures to track schema changes. This helps in handling compatibility between different versions of the schema.

2. **Use optional fields**: When adding new fields, make them optional (nullable) to maintain compatibility with older clients. This way, clients can still function with the older schema without any issues.

3. **Handle missing fields**: When consuming data from a server with a newer schema, check if a field is present before accessing it. This prevents runtime errors in case the field is not available in the older schema.

4. **Handle unrecognized fields**: When server receives requests from older clients, it may receive additional fields that it doesn't recognize. Handle these unrecognized fields gracefully to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Example of Schema Evolution with ThriftPy

Let's consider an example of schema evolution using ThriftPy. We have a simple Thrift structure called `Person` with two fields: `name` and `age`. Now, we want to add a new field called `email` to the `Person` structure without breaking compatibility with existing clients.

```python
struct Person {
    1: required string name,
    2: required i32 age,
    3: optional string email
}
```

To handle compatibility:

1. On the server side, we modify the structure definition to include the new `email` field:

```python
struct Person {
    1: required string name,
    2: required i32 age,
    3: optional string email,
    // Additional fields if required
}
```

2. On the client side, we update the code to handle the possibility of the `email` field being missing:

```python
person = get_person()
if hasattr(person, 'email'):
    email = person.email
else:
    email = None
```

By using optional fields and handling missing fields, we ensure that both new and old clients can work with the updated schema.

## Conclusion

Schema evolution is a crucial aspect of working with ThriftPy and Apache Thrift in general. By following best practices such as versioning, using optional fields, handling missing and unrecognized fields, you can smoothly evolve your Thrift schemas without disrupting compatibility with existing clients and servers.
