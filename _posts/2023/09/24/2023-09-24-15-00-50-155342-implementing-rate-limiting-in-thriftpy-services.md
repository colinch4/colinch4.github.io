What is rate limiting?
----------------------
Rate limiting is a technique that allows you to control the rate at which clients can make requests to your service. It helps in protecting your infrastructure from being overwhelmed and ensures fair usage of resources. By specifying a limit on the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame, you can prevent abuse, control traffic, and maintain the quality of service.

Introducing `ratelimiter`
--------------------------
`ratelimiter` is a Python library that provides a simple and flexible interface to implement rate limiting. It offers features like token bucket and fixed window rate limiting algorithms, which are widely used in distributed systems to regulate traffic. With `ratelimiter`, you can easily integrate rate limiting into your ThriftPy services and have fine-grained control over request rates.

Implementation steps
--------------------
Let's walkthrough the steps required to implement rate limiting in your ThriftPy services using `ratelimiter`.

1. Install `ratelimiter`:
   ```
   pip install ratelimiter
   ```

2. Import the required modules in your ThriftPy service code:
   ```python
   import thriftpy2
   from thriftpy2 import rpc
   from ratelimiter import RateLimiter
   ```

3. Initialize a rate limiter with the desired rate limit, for example, 100 requests per minute:
   ```python
   rate_limit = RateLimiter(max_calls=100, period=60)
   ```

4. Decorate the ThriftPy service method(s) that you want to rate limit with the rate limiter:
   ```python
   @rate_limit
   @rpc
   def my_service_method(self, argument1, argument2):
       # Implement your service logic here
       ...
   ```

5. That's it! Your ThriftPy service method is now rate limited. Clients invoking this method will be subject to the rate limit specified.

Summary
-------
In this blog post, we have discussed the importance of rate limiting in ThriftPy services and how to implement it using the `ratelimiter` library. Rate limiting helps in controlling resource usage, preventing abuse, and maintaining the quality of service. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate rate limiting into your ThriftPy services and have better control over traffic management. #rateLimiting #ThriftPy
