ThriftPy is a Python library that provides an easy way to implement Thrift clients and servers. It follows the Thrift protocol for communication between servers and clients. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle errors and error codes in ThriftPy. 

ThriftPy supports two types of errors - `TApplicationException` and custom exceptions. 

## TApplicationException

`TApplicationException` is a generic exception that is used when a Thrift service encounters an error. It is automatically thrown by ThriftPy when a server encounters an exception while processing a request. 

To handle `TApplicationException`, you can catch it in your ThriftPy client code and take appropriate actions based on the error message. Here's an example of how to catch and handle a `TApplicationException`:

```python
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.transport import TSocket, TTransport

# Create a ThriftPy client
transport = TSocket.TSocket("localhost", 9090)
transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)
protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)
client = MyThriftService.Client(protocol)

try:
    transport.open()
    response = client.someMethod()
    transport.close()
except MyThriftService.TApplicationException as e:
    # Handle TApplicationException
    print(f"An error occurred: {e.message}")
```

## Custom Exceptions

In addition to `TApplicationException`, you can define your own custom exceptions in ThriftPy to represent specific errors in your application. To define a custom exception, create a new Thrift file (.thrift) and define the exception using the `exception` keyword. Here's an example:

```thrift
exception CustomException {
    1: required string message;
}
```

After defining the custom exception in the Thrift file, compile the .thrift file to generate the corresponding Python code. Then, you can raise and handle the custom exception in your ThriftPy code. Here's an example:

```python
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.transport import TSocket, TTransport

# Create a ThriftPy client
transport = TSocket.TSocket("localhost", 9090)
transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)
protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)
client = MyThriftService.Client(protocol)

try:
    transport.open()
    response = client.someMethod()
    transport.close()
except MyThriftService.CustomException as e:
    # Handle CustomException
    print(f"Custom exception occurred: {e.message}")
```

By defining your own custom exceptions, you can provide more specific error information to the client and handle different errors in a more granular way.

## Conclusion

Error handling is an important aspect of any application, and ThriftPy provides mechanisms to handle errors and error codes effectively. By using `TApplicationException` and custom exceptions, you can handle errors gracefully and provide detailed error information to clients. This ensures a smoother communication flow between servers and clients in ThriftPy applications.
