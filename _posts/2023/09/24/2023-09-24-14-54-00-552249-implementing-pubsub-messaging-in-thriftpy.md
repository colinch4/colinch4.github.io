Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe) messaging is a messaging pattern that allows messages to be published to a topic and then delivered to multiple subscribers who have expressed interest in that topic. This pattern is commonly used in distributed systems to enable decoupling of components and efficient information sharing.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pub/sub messaging using ThriftPy, a library that provides Python bindings for Apache Thrift, a highly efficient and scalable RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework.

## Setting up the Environment

Before we dive into the implementation, we need to make sure that we have ThriftPy installed in our Python environment. We can install it using pip:

```
$ pip install thrift
$ pip install thriftpy2
```

## Defining the Pub/Sub Service

First, let's define the **Thrift** definitions for our pub/sub service. We will have two main entities: the `Publisher` and the `Subscriber`.

```thrift
namespace py com.example.pubsub

struct Message {
    1: required string content,
}

service PubSubService {
    void publish(1: Message message),
    void subscribe(1: string topic),
}
```

In this example, we define a simple `Message` struct with a single field `content` to hold the actual message content. The `PubSubService` service provides two methods: `publish` for publishing messages and `subscribe` for subscribing to a specific topic.

## Implementing the Pub/Sub Service

To implement the pub/sub service using ThriftPy, we need to create a server and client.

### Server-side Implementation

```python
import thriftpy2
from thriftpy2.rpc import make_server

pubsub_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pubsub.thrift")

class PubSubHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscribers = {}

    def publish(self, message):
        for subscriber in self.subscribers.values():
            subscriber.receive(message.content)

    def subscribe(self, topic, subscriber):
        self.subscribers[subscriber] = topic

pubsub_service = pubsub_thrift.PubSubService
handler = PubSubHandler()
processor = pubsub_thrift.PubSubService.Processor(handler)
server = make_server(pubsub_service, processor, 'localhost', 9090)
server.serve()
```

In the server-side implementation, we create a `PubSubHandler` class that handles the actual business logic of the pub/sub service. The `PubSubHandler` maintains a dictionary `subscribers` where the subscriber's object is the key and the topic is the value.

The `publish` method iterates through all subscribers and calls their `receive` method with the message content. The `subscribe` method adds the subscriber to the `subscribers` dictionary with the corresponding topic.

Finally, we create a Thrift server using the `make_server` function and serve it on `localhost` port `9090`.

### Client-side Implementation

On the client-side, we can use ThriftPy to generate Python bindings for the `PubSubService` and use them to interact with the pub/sub server.

```python
import thriftpy2
from thriftpy2.rpc import make_client

pubsub_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pubsub.thrift")

client = make_client(pubsub_thrift.PubSubService, 'localhost', 9090)

class Subscriber:
    def receive(self, message):
        print("Received message:", message)

subscriber = Subscriber()
client.subscribe("topic1", subscriber)

message = pubsub_thrift.Message("Hello World!")
client.publish(message)
```

In the client-side implementation, we create a `Subscriber` class with a `receive` method that will be called when a message is received. We create an instance of the `Subscriber` class and then subscribe it to the topic "topic1" using the `subscribe` method of the client.

We also create a `Message` instance with the content "Hello World!" and publish it using the `publish` method of the client.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement pub/sub messaging using ThriftPy. We defined the Thrift definitions for our pub/sub service, implemented the server-side logic, and created a client to interact with the server.

By leveraging ThriftPy's Python bindings for Apache Thrift, we can easily build efficient and scalable pub/sub messaging systems in Python.
