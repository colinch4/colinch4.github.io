In this blog post, we will explore how to use ThriftPy annotations to add metadata to your Thrift services and structures. ThriftPy provides a Python implementation of the Apache Thrift framework, allowing you to define reusable data types and services for inter-process communication.

## What is ThriftPy?

ThriftPy is a Python library that enables you to write Thrift services and structures in Python. It is built on top of the Apache Thrift framework and provides a more Pythonic way of defining and working with Thrift types.

## Why use metadata in ThriftPy?

Metadata allows you to add additional information to your Thrift services and structures. This information can be used to provide hints or instructions to clients or to serialize and deserialize the data more efficiently.

## How to use ThriftPy annotations

To add metadata to your Thrift services and structures, you can use the `@thrift.py3.annotation` decorator provided by ThriftPy. Let's look at an example:

```python
import thrift.py3 as thrift

@thrift.py3.annotation("key", "value")
class MyStruct(thrift.ThriftStruct):
    field1: str
    field2: int
```

In this example, we are using the `@thrift.py3.annotation` decorator to add a key-value pair as metadata to the `MyStruct` structure. This metadata can be accessed at runtime using the `thrift.Metadata` class provided by ThriftPy.

```python
metadata = thrift.Metadata.get_structure_metadata(MyStruct)
key = metadata.get("key")
```

By using the `get_structure_metadata` method, we can retrieve the metadata associated with the `MyStruct` structure. In this example, `key` will be equal to `"value"`. You can use this metadata to make decisions in your application based on the provided annotations.

## Conclusion

ThriftPy annotations provide a convenient way to add metadata to your Thrift services and structures. This metadata can be used to provide additional information to clients or to optimize serialization and deserialization. By using the `@thrift.py3.annotation` decorator and the `thrift.Metadata` class, you can easily add and access metadata in your ThriftPy code.
