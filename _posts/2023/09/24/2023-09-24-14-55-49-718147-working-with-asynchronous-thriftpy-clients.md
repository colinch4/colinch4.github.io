ThriftPy is a Python library that allows you to work with Apache Thrift, a cross-language RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework. By using ThriftPy, you can define your services and data structures in a Thrift IDL (Interface Definition Language), and ThriftPy will generate Python code that can be used to implement your services.

To work with asynchronous clients in ThriftPy, you need to use the `TAsyncClient` class. This class extends the regular `TClient` class and provides additional methods for working with asynchronous operations.

Here's an example of how to use the `TAsyncClient` class to make asynchronous calls:

```python
from thrift.transport import TSocket, TTransport
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.asyncio import TAsyncTransport
from my_thrift import MyService

async def make_async_call():
    # Create a socket transport
    transport = TSocket.TSocket('localhost', 9090)
    transport = TTransport.TFramedTransport(transport)
    protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)

    # Create an asynchronous transport
    async_transport = TAsyncTransport.TAsyncTransport(transport)

    # Create an asynchronous client
    client = MyService.Client(async_transport, protocol)

    # Open the transport
    await async_transport.open()

    try:
        # Make asynchronous calls
        result = await client.myMethod(arg1, arg2)

        # Process result
        print(result)
    finally:
        # Close the transport
        await async_transport.close()

# Run the asynchronous function
asyncio.run(make_async_call())
```

In the example above, we first create a socket transport using `TSocket.TSocket`, and then wrap it in a framed transport using `TTransport.TFramedTransport`. We also create a binary protocol using `TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol`. This ensures that our communication with the Thrift server is properly formatted.

Next, we create an asynchronous transport using `TAsyncTransport.TAsyncTransport`, passing in our regular transport and enabling support for asynchronous operations.

We then create an instance of our Thrift service client by passing our asynchronous transport and protocol objects to the `MyService.Client` constructor.

Before we can make any asynchronous calls, we need to open the transport using `async_transport.open()`. Once the transport is open, we can make our asynchronous calls using `client.myMethod` and await the result.

After processing the result, we close the transport using `async_transport.close()`.

By using the `TAsyncClient` class and following the example above, you can effectively work with asynchronous ThriftPy clients and build high-performance applications. Remember to handle exceptions appropriately and ensure proper management of your asynchronous resources.
