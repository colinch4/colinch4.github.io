In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a distributed publish/subscribe (pub/sub) system using the ThriftPy library. ThriftPy is a Python implementation of Apache Thrift, a scalable cross-language framework for building robust and efficient distributed systems.

## What is pub/sub?

Pub/sub is a messaging pattern where publishers send messages to a central broker, and subscribers receive those messages from the broker. It is a popular choice for building scalable and decoupled systems, as it allows multiple publishers and subscribers to interact without the need for direct communication.

## Why use ThriftPy?

ThriftPy provides a simple and efficient way to define and communicate between different components in a distributed system. It allows you to define your data models and services using a simple interface definition language (IDL) and generates code for multiple languages, including Python. This makes it an ideal choice for implementing pub/sub distributed systems.

## Setting up the environment

Before we dive into the code, let's set up our environment. We'll assume you already have Python and pip installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install thrift thriftpy
```

## Defining the data models

The first step is to define the data models for our pub/sub system. We'll use the Thrift IDL to define our data structures. Here's an example:

```thrift
namespace py pubsub

struct Message {
    1: required string topic
    2: required string data
}

struct Subscriber {
    1: required string name
    // Add any additional fields you want
}

service PubSub {
    void publish(1: Message message)
    void subscribe(1: Subscriber subscriber)
}
```

In the above example, we define a `Message` struct with `topic` and `data` fields. We also define a `Subscriber` struct with a `name` field. Finally, we define a `PubSub` service with `publish` and `subscribe` methods.

## Implementing the server

Next, let's implement the server side of our pub/sub system. We'll create a Python file named `pubsub_server.py`. Here's an example implementation:

```python
import thriftpy2
from thriftpy2.rpc import make_server

pubsub_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pubsub.thrift", module_name="pubsub")

class PubSubHandler:
    subscribers = []

    def publish(self, message):
        for subscriber in self.subscribers:
            subscriber.consume(message)

    def subscribe(self, subscriber):
        self.subscribers.append(subscriber)

def main():
    server = make_server(pubsub_thrift.PubSub, PubSubHandler(), 'localhost', 9090)
    print("Starting pub/sub server...")
    server.serve()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the above code, we import the `pubsub` module generated from our Thrift IDL. We define a `PubSubHandler` class that implements the `publish` and `subscribe` methods. The `publish` method sends the message to all registered subscribers, and the `subscribe` method adds the subscriber to the list of subscribers.

## Implementing the client

Finally, let's implement the client side of our pub/sub system. We'll create a Python file named `pubsub_client.py`. Here's an example implementation:

```python
import thriftpy2
from thriftpy2.rpc import make_client

pubsub_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pubsub.thrift", module_name="pubsub")

def main():
    client = make_client(pubsub_thrift.PubSub, 'localhost', 9090)
    subscriber = pubsub_thrift.Subscriber(name="subscriber1")
    client.subscribe(subscriber)
    print("Subscribed to pub/sub server.")

    while True:
        message = pubsub_thrift.Message(topic="topic1", data="Hello, World!")
        client.publish(message)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the above code, we import the `pubsub` module generated from our Thrift IDL. We create a client and a `Subscriber` object with a unique name. We then subscribe to the pub/sub server and continuously publish messages with a predefined topic and data.

## Running the pub/sub system

To run the pub/sub system, follow these steps:

1. Start the server by running `python pubsub_server.py`
2. Start multiple clients by running `python pubsub_client.py`

You should see the clients publishing messages, and the server sending those messages to the subscribers.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement a distributed pub/sub system using ThriftPy. We defined our data models using Thrift IDL, implemented the server and client using ThriftPy, and ran the pub/sub system. ThriftPy provides a powerful and efficient way to build distributed systems, and pub/sub is just one of the many patterns you can implement using this framework.
