To define an enum in ThriftPy, you can use the `enum` keyword followed by the name of the enum. Each value within the enum is declared using the format `value_name = value`.

Here's an example of how you can define an enum in ThriftPy:

```python
enum Color:
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3
```

In the above example, we defined an enum called "Color" with three possible values: RED, GREEN, and BLUE. Each value is assigned a numerical constant.

To use the enum in a ThriftPy struct or union, you can simply refer to it by its name, just like any other data type. Here's an example of a struct that includes an enum field:

```python
struct Car:
    1: required string make
    2: required string model
    3: required Color color
```

In this example, we have a struct called "Car" with three required fields: "make", "model", and "color". The "color" field is of type "Color", which references the enum we defined earlier.

Once you have defined an enum field and initialized it with one of the enum values, you can easily manipulate and compare the enum values in your ThriftPy application. 

For instance, you can check if a given value is equal to a specific enum value using the equality operator:

```python
car_color = Color.RED

if car_color == Color.BLUE:
    print("The car color is blue!")
else:
    print("The car color is not blue.")
```

Enums in ThriftPy provide a convenient and type-safe way to handle a predefined set of values, making your code more readable and easier to maintain. By leveraging enums, you can ensure the validity of the data flowing through your ThriftPy application, reducing the risk of errors and enhancing the overall robustness of your codebase.
