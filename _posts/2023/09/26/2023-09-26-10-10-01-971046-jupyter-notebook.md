Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports several programming languages including Python, R, and Julia. In this blog post, we will explore the key features and benefits of Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

To install Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip, a package installer for Python.
