Python IDLE, also known as Integrated Development and Learning Environment, is the default Python IDE that comes bundled with the Python installation on Windows operating systems. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing, testing, and debugging Python code.

## Getting Started

To open Python IDLE on Windows, follow these simple steps:

1. **Step 1**: Press the `Windows key` on your keyboard.
2. **Step 2**: Type `IDLE` in the search bar.
3. **Step 3**: Click on the **Python IDLE** option that appears in the search results.

## Features

### Editor Window
The Editor Window in Python IDLE allows you to write and edit your Python code. It provides various features to enhance your coding experience, such as syntax highlighting, line numbering, and auto-indentation. You can also customize the font and color scheme according to your preferences.

### Interactive Shell
Python IDLE includes an interactive Python shell, which allows you to execute Python code instantly and see the results immediately. This is useful for quick testing and experimentation.

### Debugger
Python IDLE provides a built-in debugger that helps you identify and fix errors in your code. You can set breakpoints, step through the code line by line, inspect variable values, and track the flow of execution.

### Intellisense
IDLE offers an autocomplete feature known as Intellisense, which suggests Python keywords, functions, and variable names as you type. This can help speed up your coding process and reduce mistakes.

### Code Execution
You can execute your Python code directly in Python IDLE by selecting the code you want to run and pressing the `F5` key or choosing "Run Module" from the "Run" menu. This allows you to quickly test your code without the need for a separate terminal or command prompt.
