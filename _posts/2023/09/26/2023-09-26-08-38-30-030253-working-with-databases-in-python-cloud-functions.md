If you're building an application or a service using Python Cloud Functions, you might need to interact with databases to store and retrieve data. In this blog post, we will explore different ways to work with databases in Python Cloud Functions.

## Option 1: Cloud Firestore

Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database provided by Google Cloud Platform. It offers a flexible, scalable, and serverless solution for storing and querying data. To start using Cloud Firestore in your Python Cloud Functions, you'll need to install the `firebase-admin` library.

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

# Initialize the Firebase SDK
cred = credentials.ApplicationDefault()
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {'projectId': 'your-project-id'})

# Access the Firestore database
db = firestore.client()

# Perform database operations
def my_cloud_function(request):
    # Access and query the Firestore database
    users_ref = db.collection('users')
    docs = users_ref.get()

    for doc in docs:
        print(u'{} => {}'.format(doc.id, doc.to_dict()))

    # Perform other operations

    return 'Success'
```

## Option 2: Cloud SQL

Cloud SQL is a fully-managed relational database service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It supports popular database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. To use Cloud SQL in your Python Cloud Functions, you'll need to install the necessary database driver.

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import mysql.connector

# Configure the database connection
config = {
    'user': 'your-username',
    'password': 'your-password',
    'host': 'your-database-host',
    'database': 'your-database-name',
    'unix_socket': '/cloudsql/your-connection-name'
}

# Connect to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(**config)

# Perform database operations
def my_cloud_function(request):
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Execute SQL queries
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    result = cursor.fetchall()

    for row in result:
        print(row)

    # Perform other operations

    cursor.close()

    return 'Success'
```

## Conclusion

Python Cloud Functions provide a powerful and flexible way to build serverless applications. By working with databases like Cloud Firestore and Cloud SQL, you can store and retrieve data efficiently. Whether you choose a NoSQL or a relational database, Python Cloud Functions offer seamless integration and scalability.
