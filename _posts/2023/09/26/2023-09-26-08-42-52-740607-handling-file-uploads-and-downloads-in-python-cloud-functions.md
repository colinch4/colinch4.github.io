File uploads and downloads are a common requirement for many web applications. In this article, we will explore how to handle file uploads and downloads using Python Cloud Functions. This will allow you to easily store and retrieve files from cloud storage services such as Google Cloud Storage.

## Uploading Files

To handle file uploads in Python Cloud Functions, we can make use of the `requests` library. First, we need to handle the HTTP `POST` request containing the file data. Here is an example of how the code might look:

```python
import requests

def upload_file(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        file = request.files['file']
        file.save('uploads/' + file.filename)
        return 'File uploaded successfully'
```

In this code snippet, we retrieve the uploaded file from the request using `request.files['file']`. We then save the file to a specific location, for example, the `uploads/` directory. You can customize the file storage location as per your requirements.

## Downloading Files

To handle file downloads in Python Cloud Functions, we can use the `send_from_directory` function from the `flask` library. This function allows us to send files from a specific directory to the client. Here is an example of how the code might look:

```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/download/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
def download_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory('downloads/', filename)
```

In this code snippet, we define an endpoint `/download/<filename>` that takes the filename as a parameter. When a `GET` request is made to this endpoint, the `send_from_directory` function is invoked to send the file from the `downloads/` directory to the client.

## Summary

Handling file uploads and downloads in Python Cloud Functions is straightforward. By using libraries such as `requests` for file uploads and `flask` for file downloads, you can efficiently manage file storage and retrieval in your applications.
