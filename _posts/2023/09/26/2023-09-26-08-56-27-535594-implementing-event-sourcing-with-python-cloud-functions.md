Event sourcing is a design pattern that involves capturing every change or event that occurs in an application and storing them as an immutable series of events. This pattern allows us to reconstruct the state of an application at any point in time by replaying the events.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement event sourcing using Python Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions provide a serverless execution environment and are a perfect fit for event-driven architectures.

## Setting Up the Cloud Function

First, let's set up the Cloud Function that will handle the events and store them. We will be using Google Cloud Functions, but the concept applies to other cloud providers as well.

```python
import json
from google.cloud import datastore

def event_sourcing(event, context):
    # Parse the event data
    event_data = json.loads(event)
    
    # Store the event in a datastore
    client = datastore.Client()
    kind = 'events'
    entity = client.key(kind)
    
    with client.transaction():
        event_entity = datastore.Entity(key=entity)
        event_entity.update(event_data)
        client.put(event_entity)
```

In this example, we are using the Google Cloud client library to interact with the Datastore service. The `event_sourcing` function takes an event and context as input, then parses the event data and stores it in a datastore.

## Handling Events

Next, let's illustrate how to handle the stored events to reconstruct the state of the application. We will add another Cloud Function to handle these events.

```python
import json
from google.cloud import datastore

def handle_event(event, context):
    # Get the event ID
    event_id = event['id']

    # Retrieve the event from the datastore
    client = datastore.Client()
    kind = 'events'
    entity = client.key(kind, int(event_id))
    event_entity = client.get(entity)

    # Process the event and update our application state
    # ...

    # Store the updated state in the datastore
    kind = 'state'
    entity = client.key(kind)
    
    with client.transaction():
        state_entity = datastore.Entity(key=entity)
        state_entity.update(updated_state)
        client.put(state_entity)
```

In this example, we retrieve a specific event from the datastore based on its ID. We then process the event to update the application state. Finally, we store the updated state in another datastore entity.

## Conclusion

Implementing event sourcing with Python Cloud Functions allows us to capture and store every event in our application, enabling us to rebuild the application state at any given time. This design pattern is powerful for maintaining a historical record and auditing changes.

By using Cloud Functions, we can leverage the scalability and serverless nature of the cloud to handle events efficiently and reliably.
