## Getting Started with CodernityDB-Py

### Installation

You can install CodernityDB-Py using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

### Creating a Database

To create a database instance, you can use the `Database` class provided by CodernityDB-Py, as shown in the example below:

```python
from CodernityDB import Database

# Create a new database instance
db = Database("/path/to/database")

# Open the database connection
db.open()
```

### Storing Data

To save data into the database, you need to create a document and call the `insert` method:

```python
document = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Insert the document into the database
db.insert(document)
```

### Retrieving Data

You can query the database using various criteria to retrieve the desired data. Here's an example of retrieving all documents with a certain age:

```python
results = db.get_many({"age": 25})
for doc in results:
    print(doc)
```

### Closing the Database

Once you are done with the database operations, it's important to close the connection using the `close` method:

```python
# Close the database connection
db.close()
```
