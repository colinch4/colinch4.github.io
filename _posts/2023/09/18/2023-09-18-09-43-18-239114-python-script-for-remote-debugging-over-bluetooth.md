Are you tired of connecting your device to your computer using a USB cable just for remote debugging? Well, here's a solution for you! In this blog post, we will discuss how to set up remote debugging over Bluetooth using Python.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A device running Python
- A computer running Python
- Bluetooth capabilities on both devices

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, let's install the necessary libraries. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```python
pip install PyBluez
pip install pydevd-pycharm
```

These libraries will enable us to establish a Bluetooth connection and facilitate remote debugging.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Debugger
Before we dive into the code, we need to set up the debugger in our Python script. Add the following code snippet at the top of your script:

```python
import pydevd_pycharm

# Set up the debugger
pydevd_pycharm.settrace('<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>')
```

Replace `<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>` with the IP address of your computer. You can find your IP address by running the command `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS) in your terminal.

## Step 3: Establishing a Bluetooth Connection
Now, let's move on to connecting our devices over Bluetooth. Add the following code snippet at the beginning of your script:

```python
import bluetooth

# Search for nearby devices
nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()

# Select the desired device (replace `<DEVICE_NAME>` with your device's name)
for device in nearby_devices:
    if '<DEVICE_NAME>' in bluetooth.lookup_name(device):
        device_address = device
        break

# Establish the Bluetooth connection
sock = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
sock.connect((device_address, 1))
```

Replace `<DEVICE_NAME>` with the name of the device you want to debug remotely.

## Step 4: Running the Script
Now, you are ready to run your script and start remote debugging over Bluetooth! Make sure that both your computer and the device are within Bluetooth range.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to set up remote debugging over Bluetooth using Python. Now, you can easily debug your Python scripts without the hassle of connecting the device via USB. Happy coding!
