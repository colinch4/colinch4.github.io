In this article, we will explore how to write a Python script to monitor Bluetooth audio devices and their connection status. This script can be useful for automating certain tasks or for gathering information about the Bluetooth devices around you.

### Getting Started

To begin with, we need to install the `pybluez` library, which provides a Python interface for working with Bluetooth devices. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the library:

```python
pip install pybluez
```

### Code Implementation

Now, let's write the Python script to monitor Bluetooth audio devices and their connection status. We will start by importing the necessary libraries and defining some variables:

```python
import bluetooth

# UUID for the Audio Sink service
uuid = "0000111E-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB"

# List of audio devices
audio_devices = {}

# Function to check device connection status
def check_connection_status(device_address):
    service_matches = bluetooth.find_service(uuid=uuid, address=device_address)
    return len(service_matches) > 0

# Function to monitor audio devices
def monitor_audio_devices():
    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()

    for device_address in nearby_devices:
        device_name = bluetooth.lookup_name(device_address)
        connection_status = check_connection_status(device_address)
        
        audio_devices[device_name] = connection_status

    print("Audio Devices:")
    for device, status in audio_devices.items():
        if status:
            print(device + " (Connected)")
        else:
            print(device + " (Not Connected)")
```

In the above code, we import the `bluetooth` module and define a UUID for the Audio Sink service. We also create an empty `audio_devices` dictionary to store the device names and their connection status.

The `check_connection_status` function uses the `find_service` method from the `bluetooth` module to check if the device has the Audio Sink service. If a service with the specified UUID is found, it means the device is connected.

The `monitor_audio_devices` function uses the `discover_devices` method from the `bluetooth` module to get a list of nearby Bluetooth devices. It then iterates over the list, looks up the device name using `lookup_name`, and calls `check_connection_status` to determine the connection status. Finally, it prints the list of audio devices and their connection status.

### Running the Script

Before running the script, make sure your Bluetooth adapter is enabled. You can run the script by executing the following command in the terminal:

```python
python bluetooth_monitor.py
```

You should see the list of nearby audio devices and their connection status printed in the terminal.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to write a Python script to monitor Bluetooth audio devices and their connection status. You can further enhance this script by adding additional functionality, such as automatically connecting to a specific device or performing actions based on the connection status.

Remember to include the necessary error handling in your code to handle scenarios where Bluetooth devices are not available or the connection status cannot be determined.
