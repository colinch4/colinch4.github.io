In this blog post, we will explore how to build a Bluetooth-controlled robotic vacuum cleaner using Python. This project combines the power of Python programming with Bluetooth technology to create a practical and efficient vacuum cleaner.

## Materials Required

Before we dive into the technical details, here are the materials you'll need to build this project:

- Raspberry Pi or any other microcontroller with Bluetooth capabilities.
- Robot vacuum cleaner chassis.
- Motor drivers to control the movement of the vacuum cleaner.
- Bluetooth module compatible with the microcontroller.
- Power source (battery or power adapter).
- Jumper wires.
- Breadboard (optional).

## Setting up the Hardware

1. Start by assembling the robot vacuum cleaner chassis according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2. Connect the motor drivers to the microcontroller. The number of motor drivers required depends on the number of motors in your vacuum cleaner. Typically, there will be separate drivers for the wheels and the vacuum motor.

3. Place the microcontroller board on the chassis securely.

4. Connect the Bluetooth module to the microcontroller. Ensure that the module is properly powered and connected.

5. Connect the motor drivers to the respective motors. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper wiring.

6. Power up the microcontroller using a suitable power source.

## Installing Dependencies

To control the vacuum cleaner using Bluetooth, we need to install the necessary Python libraries. Open the terminal and execute the following commands:

```
pip install PyBluez
pip install evdev
```

These libraries will allow us to interact with the Bluetooth module and handle input from peripherals.

## Writing the Python Code

1. Begin by importing the required libraries:

```python
import bluetooth
from evdev import InputDevice, ecodes
```

2. Initialize the Bluetooth connection:

```python
nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()
for device in nearby_devices:
    if "YOUR_DEVICE_NAME" in bluetooth.lookup_name(device):
        bd_addr = device
        break
```

Replace `"YOUR_DEVICE_NAME"` with the name of your Bluetooth device. This code snippet will search for available Bluetooth devices and connect to the specified one.

3. Create an input device object to handle keyboard input:

```python
dev = InputDevice('/dev/input/eventX')
```

Replace `'eventX'` with the event number corresponding to your keyboard. This event number can be found by running the command `ls /dev/input/`.

4. Implement the vacuum cleaner control logic:

```python
for event in dev.read_loop():
    if event.type == ecodes.EV_KEY:
        key_event = categorize(event)
        
        if key_event.keystate == KeyEvent.key_down:
            if key_event.keycode[0] == 'KEY_W':
                # Move forward logic
                
            if key_event.keycode[0] == 'KEY_A':
                # Turn left logic
                
            if key_event.keycode[0] == 'KEY_D':
                # Turn right logic
                
            if key_event.keycode[0] == 'KEY_S':
                # Move backward logic
```

Replace the comments with the appropriate motor control logic, depending on your specific vacuum cleaner's movement mechanisms.

5. Deploy the code and run the script. Your vacuum cleaner is now ready to be controlled through Bluetooth using the specified keys!

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we covered the process of building a Bluetooth-controlled robotic vacuum cleaner using Python. By combining Python programming with Bluetooth technology, you can create a customized, efficient, and practical cleaning solution. Feel free to enhance this project further by adding features like obstacle detection or remote control through a mobile application.
