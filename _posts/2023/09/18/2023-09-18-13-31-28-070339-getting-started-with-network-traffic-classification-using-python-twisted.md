Network traffic classification plays a crucial role in analyzing and managing network traffic effectively. By classifying traffic into different categories, we can better understand its behavior, identify patterns, and take appropriate actions. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform network traffic classification using Python Twisted, a popular asynchronous networking framework.

## What is Python Twisted?

Python Twisted is an event-driven networking framework used for building networked applications. It provides a high-level API for writing network protocols and applications, making it easier to develop robust and scalable networking software.

## Setting up the environment

Before we start classifying network traffic, let's set up our environment. You will need Python 3.x installed on your machine. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install twisted
```

## Capturing network traffic

To classify network traffic, we first need to capture it. Twisted provides a module called `twisted.pcap` that allows us to capture packets from a network interface. The following code snippet demonstrates how to capture network packets and print their contents:

```python
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.protocols import pcap

class PacketCapture(pcap.PacketReceiver):
    def packetReceived(self, packet, header):
        print(packet)

pcap.listenPacket('eth0', PacketCapture())

reactor.run()
```

In this code, we create a `PacketCapture` class that subclasses `pcap.PacketReceiver`. The `packetReceived` method is called whenever a new packet is captured. We print the packet's contents for demonstration purposes.

## Classifying network traffic

Once we have captured network traffic, we can analyze and classify it using various techniques. One simple approach is to examine the packet's source and destination addresses, ports, or protocol type. In this example, let's classify packets as either HTTP or non-HTTP traffic based on TCP port numbers:

```python
def packetReceived(self, packet, header):
    eth_frame = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(packet)
    if isinstance(eth_frame.data, dpkt.ip.IP):
        ip_packet = eth_frame.data
        if isinstance(ip_packet.data, dpkt.tcp.TCP):
            tcp_segment = ip_packet.data
            if tcp_segment.dport == 80 or tcp_segment.dport == 8080:
                print("HTTP traffic: ", packet)
            else:
                print("Non-HTTP traffic: ", packet)
```

In this example, we extract the TCP segment from the IP packet and check if the destination port is either 80 (HTTP) or 8080 (common alternative HTTP port). We then classify the packet accordingly.

## Conclusion

Network traffic classification using Python Twisted provides a valuable tool for understanding and managing network traffic. By using Twisted's capabilities, you can capture network packets, analyze their contents, and classify them based on various criteria. This can be further extended to meet your specific requirements, such as detecting and analyzing specific network protocols or anomalies.
