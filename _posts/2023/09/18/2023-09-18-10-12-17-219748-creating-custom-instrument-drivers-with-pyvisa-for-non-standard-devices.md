In the world of test and measurement, there are numerous standard instrument drivers available for popular devices. However, there are times when you need to interface with a non-standard or custom device that doesn't have a pre-built driver. In such cases, **PyVISA**, a Python library for controlling instruments and measurement devices, comes to the rescue. With PyVISA, you can easily create custom instrument drivers to communicate with non-standard devices.

## What is PyVISA?

**PyVISA** is a Python library that enables communication with instruments and measurement devices over various standard protocols such as GPIB, USB, Ethernet, and more. It provides a uniform API (Application Programming Interface) for controlling different instruments, regardless of the underlying communication protocol.

## Why Create Custom Instrument Drivers?

Creating a custom instrument driver allows you to abstract the low-level details of instrument communication and provides a higher-level interface for interacting with the device. This simplifies the overall integration process and makes it easier to control the device within your Python application.

## Getting Started

To create a custom instrument driver using PyVISA, follow these steps:

1. **Install PyVISA**: Start by installing the PyVISA library. You can install it using pip with the command: `pip install pyvisa`.

2. **Discover the Instrument**: Connect the non-standard instrument to your computer using the appropriate interface (e.g., USB, Ethernet, etc.). Determine the communication details such as the address (e.g., IP address for Ethernet-based devices) and the protocol (e.g., USBTMC for USB-based devices).

3. **Initialize PyVISA**: Initialize the PyVISA library by opening a session to the instrument using the appropriate backend and address details. For example, to open a USBTMC device, initialize the library as follows:

```python
import visa
rm = visa.ResourceManager()
instrument = rm.open_resource('USB::manufacturer_id::model_code::serial_number::INSTR')
```

4. **Send and Receive Commands**: Once the instrument session is opened, you can send commands and receive responses from the device using standard SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) syntax. PyVISA provides methods like `write` and `query` to send commands and receive responses. For example:

```python
instrument.write('SET VOLTAGE 10')  # Set voltage to 10 volts
response = instrument.query('MEASURE?')  # Query the measurement value
```

5. **Implement Custom Methods**: Create custom methods in your instrument driver class to encapsulate common functionality or complex operations specific to the device. This helps to abstract the device details and provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the instrument.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during communication with the instrument. PyVISA provides error handling mechanisms to help you handle these situations effectively.

## Conclusion

Creating custom instrument drivers with PyVISA allows you to seamlessly interface with non-standard or custom devices within your Python applications. By abstracting the low-level details of instrument communication, you can focus more on the higher-level functionality of controlling and acquiring data from the instrument. Whether it's a USB instrument or an Ethernet-based device, PyVISA provides a common interface for communicating with various instruments, simplifying the development process and facilitating easier integration with non-standard devices.
