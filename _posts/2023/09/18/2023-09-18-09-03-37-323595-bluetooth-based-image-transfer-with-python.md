## Introduction
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances. In this blog post, we will explore how to transfer images via Bluetooth using Python. We will use the PyBluez library, which provides a Python interface to the Bluetooth stack.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- A Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., laptop, smartphone)
- Python installed on your device
- PyBluez library installed (`pip install pybluez`)

## Step 1: Set Up a Bluetooth Server
To start the image transfer process, we need to set up a Bluetooth server to receive the image. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import bluetooth

server_socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
port = 1
server_socket.bind(("", port))
server_socket.listen(1)

client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Accepted connection from {client_address[0]}")

image_path = "received_image.jpg"
with open(image_path, "wb") as file:
    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        file.write(data)

print("Image received successfully")

client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```

This code sets up a Bluetooth socket, binds it to a specific port, and listens for incoming connections. Once a client connects, it receives the image data and writes it to a file on the server.

## Step 2: Sending the Image from Client
Now, let's move to the client side and send the image to the server. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import bluetooth

server_address = "<server_address>"
port = 1

client_socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
client_socket.connect((server_address, port))

image_path = "image.jpg"
with open(image_path, "rb") as file:
    data = file.read(1024)
    while data:
        client_socket.send(data)
        data = file.read(1024)

print("Image sent successfully")

client_socket.close()
```

In this code, replace `<server_address>` with the Bluetooth address of the server device. The client socket connects to the server and sends the image file in chunks of 1024 bytes until the entire file is sent.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to transfer images over Bluetooth using Python. We learned how to set up a Bluetooth server to receive images and how to send images from a client device. With this knowledge, you can build applications that enable image transfer between Bluetooth-enabled devices.
