In this tutorial, we will learn how to develop a Bluetooth-based music player using Python. We will leverage the `pybluez` library, which provides a comprehensive set of Bluetooth functionalities.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need the following:

- A computer or Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth capabilities
- Python installed on your machine
- `pybluez` library installed (`pip install pybluez`)

## Steps

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```python
import os
import glob
import time
from bluetooth import *
```

### Step 2: Discover nearby devices

```python
def discover_devices():
    devices = discover_devices(duration=5, lookup_names=True)
    for addr, name in devices:
        print(f"Found device: {name} ({addr})")
```

### Step 3: Connect to a nearby device

```python
def connect(device_addr):
    print(f"Connecting to {device_addr}...")
    service_matches = find_service(address=device_addr)
    if len(service_matches) == 0:
        print("No available services.")
        return
    first_match = service_matches[0]
    name = first_match["name"]
    host = first_match["host"]
    port = first_match["port"]
    sock = BluetoothSocket(RFCOMM)
    sock.connect((host, port))
    print(f"Connected to {name} ({device_addr})")
    return sock
```

### Step 4: Send music files to the connected device

```python
def send_music_files(sock):
    files = glob.glob("path/to/music/files/*.mp3")
    print(f"Found {len(files)} music files.")
    for file in files:
        with open(file, "rb") as f:
            sock.send(f.read())
        print(f"Sent {os.path.basename(file)}")
        time.sleep(1)  # Delay between sending files
    print("All files sent.")
```

### Step 5: Main function

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    discover_devices()
    device_addr = input("Enter the device address to connect: ")
    sock = connect(device_addr)
    if sock:
        send_music_files(sock)
        sock.close()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to develop a Bluetooth-based music player using Python. We utilized the `pybluez` library to discover nearby devices, establish a connection, and send music files. Feel free to explore further and enhance the functionality according to your requirements.
