Network forensics is the practice of capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify security vulnerabilities and investigate potential cyber threats. Python, with its extensive libraries and frameworks, provides a powerful platform for developing network forensic tools.

In this blog post, we will explore how to get started with network forensics using Python and the Twisted library. Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python that enables the development of network applications.

## Installing Twisted

Before we dive into network forensics, let's first install Twisted on our machine. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```shell
pip install twisted
```

This will install the latest version of Twisted from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

## Creating a Packet Sniffer

To perform network forensics, we need a packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic. Let's create a simple packet sniffer using Twisted.

```python
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor
from twisted.protocols import pcap

class PacketSniffer(protocol.Protocol):
    def __init__(self):
        self.capture = pcap.pcap(name=None, promisc=True)
        
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.capture.dispatch(1, data)
        
    def connectionLost(self, reason):
        reactor.stop()

factory = protocol.Factory()
factory.protocol = PacketSniffer

reactor.listenPacket(protocol.ThrowingDatagramProtocol(), factory)
reactor.run()
```

In the above code, we create a `PacketSniffer` class that inherits from `protocol.Protocol`, which is a base class for Twisted network protocols. In the `__init__` method, we initialize the packet capture object using `pcap.pcap`.

The `dataReceived` method is called whenever new data is received. Here, we dispatch the captured packet using `self.capture.dispatch`. Lastly, in the `connectionLost` method, we stop the reactor when the connection is lost.

To run the packet sniffer, save the script in a file `sniffer.py` and run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python sniffer.py
```

## Analyzing Captured Packets

Once we have captured packets, we can analyze them for further investigation. Twisted provides various built-in protocols that we can use for packet analysis.

Let's modify our packet sniffer to parse HTTP requests and print out the requested URLs:

```python
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor
from twisted.protocols import pcap, http

class PacketSniffer(protocol.Protocol):
    def __init__(self):
        self.capture = pcap.pcap(name=None, promisc=True)
        
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.capture.dispatch(1, data)
        
    def connectionLost(self, reason):
        reactor.stop()

class HTTPRequestAnalyzer(http.HTTPChannel):
    def requestReceived(self, command, path, version):
        print(f"Requested URL: {path}")
        
factory = protocol.Factory()
factory.protocol = PacketSniffer

reactor.listenPacket(protocol.ThrowingDatagramProtocol(), factory)
reactor.run()
```

In the modified code, we create a new class `HTTPRequestAnalyzer` that inherits from `http.HTTPChannel`. We override the `requestReceived` method to print the requested URL.

By utilizing Twisted's HTTP parsing capabilities, we can extract valuable information from captured packets.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to get started with network forensics using Python and the Twisted library. We created a basic packet sniffer to capture and analyze network traffic. We also explored how to modify the packet sniffer to parse HTTP requests and extract relevant information.

Network forensics is a complex field, and Python with Twisted provides a solid foundation for building powerful network forensic tools. With further exploration and usage of advanced protocols, we can enhance our network forensics capabilities.
