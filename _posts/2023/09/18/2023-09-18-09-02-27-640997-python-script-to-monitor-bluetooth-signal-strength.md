In this blog post, we will explore how to write a Python script to monitor the signal strength of connected Bluetooth devices. This can be useful for various applications, such as tracking the location of Bluetooth devices or monitoring the strength of a Bluetooth connection.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need to have the following:

- A computer or device with Bluetooth capabilities.
- Python installed on your system.

## Step 1: Install Required Packages

To monitor the Bluetooth signal strength, we will use the `pybluez` library, which provides Bluetooth functionality for Python. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pybluez
```

## Step 2: Write the Python Script

Open a text editor and create a new Python file, let's name it `bluetooth_signal_strength.py`. 

```python
import bluetooth

def get_signal_strength(addr):
    result = bluetooth.lookup_name(addr)
    if result is not None:
        print("Device Name: ", result)
        return bluetooth.read_rssi(addr)
    else:
        print("Device not found.")

# Replace '00:00:00:00:00:00' with the MAC address of the target Bluetooth device
target_address = '00:00:00:00:00:00'

# Call the function to get the signal strength
signal_strength = get_signal_strength(target_address)
print("Signal Strength:", signal_strength)
```

Here, we import the `bluetooth` module and define a function `get_signal_strength` which takes the MAC address of a Bluetooth device as an argument. The function uses the `lookup_name` method to get the name of the device and then reads the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) using the `read_rssi` method. If the device is found, it prints the device name and returns the signal strength, otherwise it prints a "Device not found" message.

Replace the `target_address` variable with the MAC address of the Bluetooth device you want to monitor.

## Step 3: Run the Script

Save the Python file and open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and then run the following command:

```bash
python bluetooth_signal_strength.py
```

The script will connect to the target Bluetooth device, print its name, and display the signal strength in dBm (decibel milliwatts).

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to write a Python script to monitor the signal strength of a Bluetooth device using the `pybluez` library. This script can be a useful tool for various Bluetooth-related applications and enables you to gather information about the surroundings.
