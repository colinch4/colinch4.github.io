In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a Bluetooth-based temperature and humidity monitoring system using Python. We will make use of the `pybluez` library to establish a Bluetooth connection and retrieve data from a Bluetooth-enabled device.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- `pybluez` library installed (`pip install pybluez`)

## Step 1: Scan for Bluetooth Devices

The first step is to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices and retrieve their addresses. We can achieve this using the `BluetoothSocket` class from the `pybluez` library. 

```python
import bluetooth

def scan_devices():
    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()
    for address in nearby_devices:
        print(f"Device: {bluetooth.lookup_name(address)} - Address: {address}")
```

## Step 2: Connect to Bluetooth Device

Once we have the address of the Bluetooth device we want to connect to, we can establish a connection using the `BluetoothSocket` class. We will also need to specify the Bluetooth port that the device uses for communication.

```python
def connect_to_device(address):
    port = 1  # Default Bluetooth port
    socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
    try:
        socket.connect((address, port))
        print("Connected to device")
    except bluetooth.BluetoothError as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        socket.close()
```

## Step 3: Retrieve Temperature and Humidity Data

Once connected, we can retrieve temperature and humidity data from the Bluetooth-enabled device. This depends on the specific protocols and data formats used by the device. We will assume that the device sends the temperature and humidity as a string with a specific format.

```python
def retrieve_sensor_data(address):
    port = 1  # Default Bluetooth port
    socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
    try:
        socket.connect((address, port))
        data = socket.recv(1024)  # Assuming the device sends sensor data as a string
        print(f"Sensor Data: {data}")
    except bluetooth.BluetoothError as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        socket.close()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a Bluetooth-based temperature and humidity monitoring system using Python. We have explored scanning for Bluetooth devices, connecting to a specific device, and retrieving sensor data. You can further enhance this system by integrating additional features such as data logging and real-time monitoring.
