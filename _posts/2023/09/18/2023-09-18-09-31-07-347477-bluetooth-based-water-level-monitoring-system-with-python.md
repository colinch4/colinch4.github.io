In this blog post, we will explore how to create a water level monitoring system using Bluetooth technology and Python. This system is perfect for monitoring water levels in tanks, reservoirs, or any other water storage facility.

## Hardware Requirements
1. Arduino board
2. Bluetooth module
3. Water level sensor
4. Jumper wires

## Software Requirements
1. Python
2. PyBluez library

## Setting up the Hardware
1. Connect the water level sensor to the Arduino board. Make sure to follow the sensor's datasheet for the proper connections.
2. Connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino board.
3. Power up the Arduino board.

## Setting up the Software
1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already.
2. Install the PyBluez library by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install pybluez
    ```

## Coding the Water Level Monitoring System
Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and detecting the Bluetooth devices:

```python
import bluetooth

def discover_devices():
    devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()
    for device in devices:
        print("Found device:", bluetooth.lookup_name(device))
```
Now, let's write a function to establish a Bluetooth connection and read data from the Arduino:

```python
def read_water_level():
    port = 1  # Bluetooth port number
    address = 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX'  # Arduino Bluetooth address

    sock = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
    sock.connect((address, port))

    while True:
        data = sock.recv(1024).decode()
        if data:
            print("Water level:", data)

    sock.close()
```

Finally, let's call these functions to discover devices and read the water level:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Discovering Bluetooth devices...")
    discover_devices()

    print("Reading water level...")
    read_water_level()
```

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you have built a Bluetooth-based water level monitoring system using Python. This system will help you keep track of the water levels in your storage facility in a hassle-free manner.
