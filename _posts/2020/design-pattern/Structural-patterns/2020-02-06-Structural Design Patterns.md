# Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

[![Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/adapter-mini.png)Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

[![Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/bridge-mini.png)Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)

Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

[![Composite](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/composite-mini.png)Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)

Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

[![Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/decorator-mini.png)Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)

Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

[![Facade](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/facade-mini.png)Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)

Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

[![Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/flyweight-mini.png)Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight)

Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

[![Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/proxy-mini.png)Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy)

Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
