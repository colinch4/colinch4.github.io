Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

[![Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/factory-method-mini.png)Factory Method](https://algamza.github.io/2020-02-06/Factory-Method-Design-Pattern)

Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

[![Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/abstract-factory-mini.png)Abstract Factory](https://algamza.github.io/2020-02-06/Abstract-Factory-Design-Pattern)

Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

[![Builder](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/builder-mini.png)Builder](https://algamza.github.io/2020-02-06/Builder-Design-Pattern)

Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

[![Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/prototype-mini.png)Prototype](https://algamza.github.io/2020-02-06/Prototype-Design-Pattern)

Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

[![Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/singleton-mini.png)Singleton](https://algamza.github.io/2020-02-06/Singleton-Design-Pattern)

Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
